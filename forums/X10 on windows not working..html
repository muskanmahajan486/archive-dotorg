				    <p>Trying to get X10 working on a Windows system running with a CM11A. The iPad comes back no errors but just does not work.</p>

<p>The logs look like this:</p>

<p>Breakdown in protocol, consuming all bytes in CM11AStandardTransmission after getChecksum().<br/>
Breakdown in protocol, consuming all bytes in CM11AStandardTransmission after getChecksum().<br/>
Breakdown in protocol, consuming all bytes in CM11AStandardTransmission after getChecksum().<br/>
Unable to transmit event CM11AX10EventTransmission - X10 Address Event: house code&lt;A&gt; device code&lt;1&gt;. Too many retries after unsuccessful attempts have occurred.</p>

<p>I believe that the com port is configured correctly (config.properties).</p>

<p>Any idea of what to look for/at?</p>

You can view the source code here: <a href="https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/tags/project/Controller/Controller_2_0_1/src/com/jpeterson/">https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/tags/project/Controller/Controller_2_0_1/src/com/jpeterson/</a></p>

<p>If you're able to read and write Java, it may be worth while to take a look at that code and see if you can discover the reason or create patches for it. I remember reviewing it long time ago and noticing that some of the Java I/O use looked suspicious especially when fragmented/non-buffered I/O may occur. But never had the time to look into it further (and it may require a bit more than a single line patch to rework).</p>

<p>Because of Openremote I dug out all the old X10 equipment with plans on putting it back into service. I have a bunch of it (old equipment) so I figures why not. I have to say, it's been a hassle since I started - One problem after another. Now it looks like it may not work at all.</p>

<p>So I guess I should ask, what is the best (supported) lighting automation technology to use with openremote? What has the best integrated support? It kinda looks like z-wave may be it? However, I read something (referring to an earlier version of openremote) that said the "free designer" was limited to 10 z-wave devices. Is this the case? What is the best path forward?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help/pointers.</p></font>
