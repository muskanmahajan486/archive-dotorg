				    <p>I'm new to openremote.org and the products that are being developed here. Just happened to find this site and was fascinated by the products that are developed here. The domain of the projects, that OpenRemote is involved in, is completely new to me. But, I would like to start looking more into the products and also start contributing going forward. </p>

<p>I just had a look at some of the developers documentation including this one <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Building+OpenRemote+2.0+Developer+Releases">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Building+OpenRemote+2.0+Developer+Releases</a>. If I have to start looking at the latest code and subsequently start contributing code, should I be looking at "trunk" <a href="https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/trunk/">https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/trunk/</a> or is the current development going on in some branch? Also is there some other documentation that I can go through to understand more about the projects? Any issue tracker for roadmap or some issues that I can work on to get to know more about the projects?</p>

<p>Development occurs in each developer's individual workspaces.</p>

<p>There are unassigned tasks in jira.openremote.org although they mostly assume you're already quite familiar with the codebase (see point about trunk).</p>

<p>If there's a particular task you want to take on while browsing trunk just ping us here and we'll help you forward.</p>
