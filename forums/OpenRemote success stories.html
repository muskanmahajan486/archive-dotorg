				    <p>Hello everyone,</p>


<p>I'm certain you all realise by now that I'm happy to bang on about how wonderful the team at OpenRemote are and just how amazing the Velbus integration is, but I thought it might be nice to read about other people's success stories.</p>

<p>For example, since launching the Velbus protocol in OR Pro 1.3, I've had direct contact from a number of professional installers and a handful of end users, asking for a small bit of help getting OpenRemote Pro communicating with their Velbus networks.</p>

<p>I'll be reviewing our conversations and editing the how-to guide a little.</p>


<p>However, once OR and Velbus had made a connection for each of these people, I haven't heard a peep from them.</p>


<p>Now I'm happy to assume that 'No News is Good News', but I thought it might be nice for other people who are doing research on hardware and software before taking the plunge to read a few success stories.</p>


<p>So please, if you have time, would some of you be kind enough to write a comment on here about your own good news stories.</p>


<p>I'd be delighted if Velbus featured in these stories, but the wonderful thing about OpenRemote is that a huge selection of protocols can co-exist and interact.</p>

<p>My own home has a selection of Velbus modules that control the 12 heating zones and various lighting fixtures, with a couple of DMX lighting fixtures and 2 VLC media players, with OpenRemote picking up events on the Velbus network to trigger DMX &amp; VLC events and providing the graphical user interface.</p>


<p>I have a client with 38 channels of lighting, 11 heating zones, a car turn table, garage door and some garden features all controlled with Velbus modules, with OpenRemote providing the control surface.</p>


<p>There's also a large church with a function room and house, all controlled with Velbus and OpenRemote.</p>


<p>And a growing list of interesting projects around the country.</p>


<p>But what about you?<br/>
What have you used OpenRemote for and why should someone who is yet to take the plunge choose OpenRemote?</p>


<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>


<p>Stuart</p>
