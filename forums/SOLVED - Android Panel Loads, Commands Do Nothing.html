				    <p>Solved!  I had entered "4889" for the iTach port instead of "4998"... LOL.  Now everything works exactly as expected!</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>I just got a Global Cache ethernet iTach.  I had no problem learning codes and setting up a basic OpenRemote.  When I send the commands using iLearn, they seem to work fine.  My basic panel loaded up on a Nook Tablet running rooted stock OS, but none of the buttons work.  I could be wrong, but it looks like the controller is throwing exceptions when I hit buttons, and nothing is making it to the iTach.</p>

<p>I don't think this is a configuration problem; I have no problem operating the iTach using only the iLearn software, and my Tablet had no problem detecting the controller and showing the right panel.  My commands look like this:</p>

<p>iLearn looks like this, and does exactly what I expect when I click "Send IR": <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pms4y.png">http://i.imgur.com/pms4y.png</a></p>

<p>Any help getting OpenRemote to actually send my iTach commands would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>The Windows PC I'm running the controller on has between 2 and maybe 10 active NICs, depending on what I'm doing at the time.  However, there is only ever one NIC bound to the 192.168.1.0/24 network.  Does the controller not detect the right interface based on the destination IP and local routing table?  Is there somewhere I can configure what network interface it uses?</p>

<p>I get one of these TCP timeout errors for every button click.</p></font>
