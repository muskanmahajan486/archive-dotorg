				    <p>As the topic says i'm taking my 1st (advanced) steps in HA and i'm running into something that is unclear to me. Simply because its the 1st time i see it.</p>


<p>As surfing through the OR forum etc i found "IRtrans / GlobalCaché" both have IP2IR gateways.</p>

<p>The global idea is clear to me but how does is exactly work and what is the command flow?</p>

<p>As reading from the IRtrans website i see that it optionally houses a small DB with IR codes in it. Biut why store the codes on the IR trans itself instead of sending those codes from the OpenRemote software.</p>

<p>So how can a button push in OR make a IR device at the other end (e.g.) flip a channel.</p>

Yes youbare correct, if you look at the XML you will see that the flow is the ui sends a code that refers to a command with metadata in it. In the case of IR it contains the actual code. The code comes from our cloud database in many cases. </p></font>

<p>Ok i'm almost there, so.....</p>

<p>So from the UI a command is send to the gateway. The command contains (some stuff) + the actual IR code which is (fetched from the beehive during config in the designer) right?</p>

<p>So why then should i need a local IR database on the gateway (irtrans) device? this doesnt make any sence to me (yet)?</p>

<p>And if i have devices which are not in the beehive should i learn the command to the IR trans device?? (as stated in the manual) Or should i lear the IR commands another way?</p></font>

(IMHO the notation "DB" is very ill chosen; people associates a "DB" with some real, useful, data supplied by the manufacturer.) For OR applications this is not relevant. It would probably be possible to write an interface using the IRTrans TCP Ascii API, but that would require the user to flash the "DB" himself, and to make sure that the names of both devices and commands are the same in both IRTrans and beehive/designer.</p>

<p>When it comes to "learning" (better word would be "analyzing") IR-Signals there are several possibilities. IRTrans is nether the worst, nor the best. I am following the IRTrans <a href="http://www.irtrans.com/forum">forum</a>, and it appears as analyzing IR-Signals is not really a supported use case, as opposed to "learning" in the context of generating rem-files (i.e. IRTrans' native language). My present favorite tool for analyzing (not "learning"&#33;&#33;&#33;) IR-Signals is the <a href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9405">IR Widget</a>, together with the <a href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=file&amp;file_id=8499">IR-Scope</a>open source software.</p></font>

<p>If i swith to the subject of "Learning" IR commands. What would an an ideal way for new/all users to convert their existing "remotes" into a usable format which can be used as input for the Project?</p>

<p>There are a lot of devices in the beehive but the devices i have at home are not there. So i would like to convert all the buttons i have on my remotes to commands i can use in the designer.</p>

<p>While having this info it would be a great option to add this to the beehive.</p>

<p>My (newbee) questions:</p>

<p>&#45; which device / way is preferable for learnig the IR command</p>

<p>&#45; How do we get the info into the beehive?</p></font>

<p>Easiest way today is most likely by an LIRC configuration file &#8211; if you record your IR codes using the LIRC tools then post it here on the forums, or alternatively to the LIRC project. We synchronize with the codes posted on LIRC project (can be found here: <a href="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/">http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/</a>).</p>

<p>You may want to check the above link first to make sure your device is not already there. If it is, then I just need to sync the database to include it.</p>

<p>We can probably also accommodate CCF format if necessary.</p>

<p>There's no way yet for users to directly manipulate the IR database though.</p>

From what I gather, the global cache ip-ir modules store the ir codes then commands are issued via IP<br/>
to call on those codes and send to the device being controlled.</p>

<p>Now, in the case of GC or even IRtrans, isn't it easier to just send the commnad for the code from OR<br/>
and have the CG do its thing?</p>

You learn the codes inside the irtrans and just send a command that eg "pioneer, power" should be send.<br/>
Eric is currently wokring on something where the whole ir codes is stored within OpenRemote and then converted into a format the device can send. This way you don't need to learn the codes device specific but can use our IR database.</p></font>

<p>K tells it to emit the IR sequence that follows (not sure the packet structure off the top of my head).</p>

<p>The modules can also store a library of IR commands that can be called up with ASCII commands like 'cmdT1' for store code 1.</p>

<p>The pronto format seems to be a very common format for storage or IR codes and seems the closest thing to a device neutral format, Keene IR have a Java GUI tool that can convert Pronto codes into codes compatible with their modules maybe a Pronto -&gt; Device converter would be required in this case.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Max,</p>

<p>The GlobalCaché does not support storing IR codes in the device. The TCP command that you send to the device has the full description (timing values) of the IR code to send.<br/>
So I believe this is what you meant by "have the GC do its thing".</p>

<p>For the IRTrans and the Keene, they allow both, either to send the full description of the IR code to the device (using UDP in that case) or the store the IR codes in the device itself (using a mechanism/program outside of OR) and just send a "key" to the device that will trigger sending of the code (like send "TV On").</p>

<p>As in all those cases, this is using TCP or UDP, you can use the generic protocol implements from OR to send those command.</p>

<p>We have started work on a wizard that allows to getting the codes from a Pronto XCF file (a usual file format for IR codes) and that generates the appropriate UDP or TCP command to send the codes. In that case, it does send the full code description.<br/>
You can find a discussion of this work in this  <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Re-using+IR+codes+from+Pronto+XCF+files">thread</a></p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Well there are better ways to store the IR than pronto format, but having possibility for users to import codes in pronto format is a must as this is what's most widely available on the internet.</p>

<p>We did an XCF importer for OR which can output commands for GC or IRTrans. Adding support for Keene might be a good thing to do. I'll take a look at the documentation of the format used by Keene and see if we can do that. If we do, it would be great if you can test that the generated commands do work correctly.</p></font>
