				    <p>I set up a Z-Way server some time back using the Razpberry Z-Wave module, and I set up the OpenRemote server back then as well. I had it all working fine, although my OpenRemote screens were all rudimentary at best, but they worked. </p>

<p>At some point, I think it stopped working, although I haven't really done anything with it in quite a while.</p>

<p>I went to try to get it working today, and ran into issues. The first issue was the IP of the Z-Way server changed, so I went through the setup and changed everything to a hostname so if I need to change it again, I can just change the DNS entry. But OpenRemote is not working. In the console, I get a non-stop flood of messages like this:</p>

<p>I've synced the config with the designer, and it indicated that the sync was successful, but if I tell it to 'reload configuration and clear cache', I get 'Failed to reload configuration and clear cache!'. </p>

<p>I'm reasonably certain that it's not a problem on the Z-Way end as it did work before (Although I believe I've upgraded Z-Way since then), and every HTTP command that I've copied out of OpenRemote and pasted into a web browser has done exactly what it was supposed to do on the Z-Way, for example, 'http://hostname:8083/OpenRemote/SwitchBinaryOn/8/0' turned the appropriate switch on, 'http://hostname:8083/OpenRemote/SwitchBinaryOff/8/0' turned the switch off, and so on.... so I think, for whatever reason, there's something wrong with OpenRemote, but I have no idea what. I went so far as to rename the original install and download the latest, which, while I was apparently running a 2.1 version, it was different as the zip I just downloaded was a bit bigger. No change starting with a 'blank slate'.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>
