                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The iOS console code started quite some time ago and did not evolve enough to be fully compatible with iOS 6.<br/>
The iOS console currently in the AppStore was compiled with Xcode 4.5 and SDK 5 but should work without issues on iOS 6.</p>

<p>The problem you are seeing is because you did recompile against iOS 6 SDK and some things that were tolerated under iOS 5 now crash under iOS 6.<br/>
I believe this issue occurs when you have a group with multiple screens in it, because of current code around the Pagination controller setup.</p>

<p>Issue with armv7s slice is similar, it's a lib compiled with older Xcode that does not contain code for latest devices.</p>

<p>Are you interested in working on this issue?</p></font>
