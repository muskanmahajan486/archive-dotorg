				    <p>First I'd like to acknowledge the help of <a href="http://www.universal-devices.com/" title="Maker of the ISY99 Insteon web server">Universal Devices</a>. They're the reason we're moving forward with the Insteon at this time.</p>

<p>The advantage of the ISY is that it hides many of the gory details of Insteon behind a nice API. For those of you not familiar with the Insteon protocol it is much more complicated than the X10 protocol.</p>

<p>At this time I've added the ISY to my home network. I've dedicated a few Insteon devices to use with the ISY and I've created a few scenes. I also have the ControlLinc (desktop remote) working. The Wireless RemoteLinc is giving a few problems but this may be related to a problem in my home rather than the ISY. I've tried linking the end devices to both of my Insteon PLMs but that didn't work as well as I've hoped and I really like to keep my home running (and wife happy) while I experiment with this.</p>

<p>I had been working with the ISY and a RESTful interface. It's a little scare (but simple) in that I'm still learning Java so bear with me. I did run into some problems and I'm now looking to move towards the Web Services API as it allows the reporting of event changes.</p>

<p>The rest of my testbed setup is the EEE PC and the Alix box. In addition to the Insteon I also have X10 devices to work with. I'll use both PCs to test my code but I also have to keep the rest of my home automation running. It's not easy to use your own home as a test bed. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>It wil be interesting to see how this beds down, I'll have basic HA system in place in a few more months, for the time being I have other focuses.</p>

Without my wife my house would tend toward Frankenstein's Monster. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Except at Halloween when my wife puts out all the Halloween toys (mechanical/electronic toys). We're working on Christmas but we'd prefer a little more taste than what we're seeing right now and I also don't want to go nuclear on the lights.</p>

<p>I hope to have a lot more Insteon in a few months so this will be fun. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Having the dual systems will be interesting as will having multiple Insteon PLMs (I have 3). Once I get the code figured out I'll also have to integrate Misterhouse and OpenRemote. I can't have the system dueling with each other.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I really like the Insteon, it's more dependable than x10 right out of the box. That's not to say that I haven't run into problems. Some of the same problems that bite X10 (signal black holes, dual phase bridging) can also bite Insteon. But alway be careful of using my home as a yardstick. Not many homes have a many systems as mine (heck I've got a better lab than some of the small service labs in AT&amp;T <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> ). Cost-wise Insteon is on par with the better quality X10 modules (i.e. not made by the X10 company <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> ). Of course the Insteon PLM also supports X10 so having some X10 is not a problem. This is useful as there are some X10 devices that do not have a matching deviice in the Insteon world. Also sometimes the Insteon protocol gets in it's own way and a few X10 devices get around these limitations.</p></font>
