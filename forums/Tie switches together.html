				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've managed to get the basics of a ZWave setup going - now I'm stuck.</p>

<p>I have some Light on/off switches which can be controlled via the OpenRemote or via a wall switch - the first problem is when I activate via the wall switch instead of the app - the OpenRemote doesn't seem to notice that the state of the switch has changed - this is more of an annoyance that anything else - as when I look at the app I don't know the status of the light until I try and turn it on/off.</p>

<p>this seems important - as what I would like to do next is trigger 2 completely separate light circuits to work together from either light switch. Kind of a "Virtual 2 way circuit".</p>

<p>for example, we have 3 sets of outdoor lights, all separately switched. I would like it that if I switch any one of the 3 switches, as well as switching the local switch, the other 2 circuits would come on/off - however that doesn't seem possible if OpenRemote doesn't see the status of the first switch changing.</p>

<p>Any help please?!?</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>cliff.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Cliff</p>

<p>I'll confess that I don't know anything about Z-Wave technology, but the following theory should be somewhere near right.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like you've got two issue.</p>

<p>The first is that you don't have a 'sensor' command setup in OpenRemote to check / monitor the status of your Z-Wave switch.</p>

<p>This how-to should help - <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Designer+2.0+-+Create+New+Z-Wave+Switch">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Designer+2.0+-+Create+New+Z-Wave+Switch</a></p>



<p>Secondly, linking switches to more than one device shouldn't be a major issue.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd address that within the Z-Wave configuration, rather than creating a set of rules in OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Purely because the danger of creating circular rules would be ever present.</p>

<p>That said, once you have sensor commands and 'Switch' sensors setup in OpenRemote, it would be fairly straightforward to create a rule that read the status of 1 Z-Wave switch / relay and brought everything else into line.</p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for trying...this post has been here a while with no comment...</p>

<p>yes I've managed to create the switch in the OpenRemote piece and that works fine - and there are sensors as part of that setup - I know they work as if I restart the openremote process it knows the current state of each switch.</p>

<p>the problem comes when you switch them manually - I think there needs to be some way of polling the device for its status - but that doesn't seem possible.</p>

<p>if I can get that bit sorted - then the rules to tie things together I think is relatively simple. </p>

<p>Thanks again</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>one step forwards 2 steps back I think.</p>

<p>I got this working....basically by polling the switches to see their current state...</p>

<p>rule "Lights Status "<br/>
  timer (cron: 0 * * * * ?) when eval (true) then<br/>
  execute.command("Driveway Lights-Status"); <br/>
  TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(1000);<br/>
  execute.command("Porch Lights-Status"); <br/>
end</p>

<p>I had to put the timer in as the 2nd light status would fail - this is only really any use if the schedule is running &lt; 10s intervals really as I can't have it waiting for minutes to turn the other lights on....anyway - after some testing and running this at even 1 minute intervals - after a while if seems to crash - either the end device stops responding or something in open remote stops working....</p>

<p>seems such a simple thing for the switch to tell OpenRmemote its status has changed rather than having to poll for its status....</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Cliff.</p>

<p>You need to know if you switch/dimmer is status report capable.  Then change the parameter that enable the hail option.</p>

<p>In my case i have a aeotec micro smart switch with the parameter 80 set to 1 and the status report work all the time.</p>

<p>Polling the the status constantly will keep the controller busy asking to the device it status and that spend a lot of the horsepower of you machine Rpi, x86 ... system.  If you device can't report it status change the polling  interval to 1 minute or more.</p>

<p>I think that can help.</p>

<p>I have exactly the same modules - the aeotec micro switch (I think its the 2nd version but I'd expect they're capable)</p>

<p>looking around the net this is clearly the answer I've been looking for...the question now is</p>

<p>How do you set the param 80 to 1 in OpenRemote??</p>

<p>(I completely agree - polling was never the answer!)</p>
