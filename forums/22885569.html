				    <p>Hello,<br/>
  I am trying to integrate OpenRemote to control my automation center. <br/>
Currently, I have something setup similar to what you can see here: <a href="http://hack.lenotta.com/arduino-raspberry-pi-switching-light-with-nrf24l01/">http://hack.lenotta.com/arduino-raspberry-pi-switching-light-with-nrf24l01/</a><br/>
Essentially, I have custom android code that receives data through the RF24 module from my PI and its RF24 module.</p>

<p>The script I am trying to run is fairly similar to the "switch.cpp" that is seen in the link.<br/>
OpenRemote is able to run it with the correct commands, but for some reason I cannot get it to read any Return values or to do any polling.</p>

<p>If you take a look at "switch.cpp" in the link provided, you can see where it returns a 0 or 2 for success or fail.<br/>
I have it setup to return other values depending what the arduino says.</p>

<p>Currently, my open remote is setup:<br/>
protocol: Shell execution protocol<br/>
Command parameter: -f status<br/>
Polling interval: 5s<br/>
RegularExpression: (5|6|7|8)\sreceived<br/>
Sensor name: status (just a text sensor for now)</p>

<p>I can monitor my arduino and see whenever the switch script is called.  It works fine if I call it as pushing just a button, but the polling interval does not seem to ever trigger it.<br/>
The return value never seems to make it to Openremote to update the sensor.</p>

<p>Does OpenRemote support c++ coding?<br/>
Am I missing something?</p>

<p>I apologize, I am completely new at this but could not find anything that was relevant to what I am seeing.<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
