				    <p>Hi people,</p>

<p>I am a graduate student at carnegie mellon currently working on secure home networks for my master's thesis. I need to design a centrally managed home network as a first step for my research work. I have looked up a lot of forums and I am confused by the choices I have for designing a smart home. What I want to know is that which technology is the most convenient to program? I know there are API's for x10 devices and I have also seen the developers manual for INSTEON and that does not look friendly at all. What about Zigbee/Z Wave ? Are there enough such devices around? Are they open? I just need some suggestions on what would be the best choice for implementing a smart home.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Sid</p>

<p>it is hard to talk about "best" solution in abstract, it heavily depends on how much you want to spend.</p>

<p>X10 is just one of the oldest standards and everywhere. It is also very low cost. You will find it lacks in programming.&nbsp; There are zigbee/zwave devices around yes.</p>

<p>Insteon is just a tad more expensive and reliable.&nbsp; We do not support Insteon at the moment.&nbsp; If you get around to programming for it we would welcome that contribution.</p>

<p>Then if you can spend more control 4,</p>

<p>more Lutron</p>

<p>more crestron etc</p>

<p>and I am only talking lights here. </p></font>
