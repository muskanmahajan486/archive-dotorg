				    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://genohm.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=9">http://genohm.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=9</a></p>

<p>an KNX world</p>

<p><b>KNX/EIB Gateway</b> offers bi-directional communication between KNX/EIB automation bus and other networks.</p>

<p><b>ZigBee/6lowpan&nbsp; to KNX/EIB Mapper</b> offers ZigBee/6lowpan&nbsp; sensor network inclusion in KNX/EIB automation network.</p>

<p><b>6LoWPAN on 2.4Ghz and 868MHz</b></p>

<p>6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network<b>s</b>. 6LoWPAN defines header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over 802.15.4 based networks. Thanks to this technology GenOHM end node devices could be accessed directly by IP address from any supported network, moreover you can configure them with DNS name,advanced security mechanisms, firewall, load-balancing and other TCP/IP networking features. You have much more control and more obvious work with 6LoWPAN networks rather than with ZigBee networks. It's also easier to integrate the network in monitoring and accounting applications.</p>

<p>Main advantages of 6LoWPAN</p>
<ul>
	<li>Full support of complex network topologies &#45;&nbsp; mesh, star, point-to-point, hybrid</li>
	<li>Interoperability with all other IP-based networks</li>
	<li>Possibility to name and route each separate sensor node to any IP-enabled device</li>
	<li>Established TCP/IP network possibilities: addressing, naming, tools (Ping, Traceroute, SNMP), advanced security mechanisms (authentication, access control, data encryption, firewall) providing invulnerable data integrity, proxy architectures (Caching, Load balancing, NAT), application level data model and services (HTTP, HTML, XML, web services)</li>
</ul>


<p><b>XMPP for communication with sensors</b></p>

<p>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication. In GenOHM modules XMPP is used to organize communication between GenOHM module and it's connected sensors. It allows for easy two-way communication, so no polling has to be used. This protocol is used since a huge count of sensors could be connected to one GenOHM device and for controlling them, standard serial tunnels will suffer from overload and inconvenient usage.</p>
