				    <p>Good day to you all.</p>

<p>first of all great thing your working on, i hope soon i will be able to sell system with openremote running to our knx clients (only hardware cost ofcource)<br/>
meanwhile i am trying to get it running after it seised up a fiew weeks ago</p>

<p>i got it running again on my synology nas, but could not load any panels.<br/>
so i figured it was still broken somehow and ran the server on my pc, loaded the stuff in it from the designer. <br/>
but i still can't load any panels, neither on my ipad3 or my samsung galaxy ace.<br/>
it detects the server just fine, but it won't load the panels, and so i can't check if the rest works.</p>

<p>i found another post about it, but it hasn't been resolved on there either, and i am not sure it was the exact same problem.</p>

<p>if needed, my phone is rooted and my ipad jailbroken on 5.1 so i can look up aditional stuff.</p>
