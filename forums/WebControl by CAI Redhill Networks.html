				    <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I have been using the board called WebControl from CAI. This has 8 Input, 8 Output, 3 analog inputs, 1-wire temperature, humidity, internal 4000 lines of code capability, and is X10 compatible using 2 of the outputs and an RF transmitter. It is an exceptional value and can be had for around 30 bucks from Amazon or Ebay. I have boards 2 running.</p>

<p>I have installed OR controller, made a panel, and have it operating on my Android. I can turn on outputs on the Webcontrol board via 3G wireless, though internet, through my router, and on to my home LAN. So that is good.</p>

<p>What I can not figure out with OR is if I can retrieve and display data FROM Webcontrol or other web devices. For example, to receive the status of a single digital input, say DI2, I would type in my browser:</p>

<p><a href="http://MYIPADDRESS:PORT/geti2.cgi">http://MYIPADDRESS:PORT/geti2.cgi</a> This would return a "0" or "1"</p>

<p>If I want the status of the entire board I would type in my browser:</p>

<p><a href="http://MYIPADDRESS:PORT/api/status.xml">http://MYIPADDRESS:PORT/api/status.xml</a>   This would return a lengthy XML file with status of everything on the board.</p>

<p>Can OR retrieve this data? If so, how do I do it. I have searched the forum and documentation to no avail.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Mike</p>

sounds like an interesting board. Do you have more information about it?</p>

<p>The first status call should be already possible with the HTTP protocol. Just create a HTTP protocol command and use the given URL. After that, create a custom sensor and link that to the new command. The custom sensor can return your on values (states) based on the returned string from the HTTP command.</p>

<p>The second call is not yet possible, but we are currently extending the HTTP protocol to support XPath expressions. This way you could parse the returned XML with XPath and give the XPath result to a sensor.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information. I was able to get the point status reported to my Droid from the webcontrol. So one problem solved!</p>

<p>I will be trying some other things and probably asking more questions!</p>

<p>Regarding the Webcontrol board, here is the link:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redhillnetworks.com/products/webcontrol/index.html">http://www.redhillnetworks.com/products/webcontrol/index.html</a></p>

<p>I also designed and built for the webcontrol a sister board which has an I/O/5V and 9V power supply that has opto isolators for the inputs and darlington drivers for the outputs and LEDS for all I/O. </p>

<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Mike</p></font>

<p>Do you sell the sister boards for the webcontrol board?  I would love more info, as these CAI boards seem to be the biggest bang for the buck.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
