				    <p>FIXED!!! <br/>
I HAD TO REINSTALL THE CONTROLLER.</p>


<p>I have a set of rules based on cron/timer.<br/>
Up until now everything has been working flawlessly for many months.</p>

<p>Today I decided to add a new rule that included at cron function.<br/>
However, whatever I did, the rule did not execute.<br/>
After many different trials I could not make it to work.<br/>
I know my rule is written correct, but not triggering so I decided to try and alter the time settings on one of<br/>
my rules that are currently working.</p>

<p>This rule worked this morning:</p>

<p>rule "WAKING UP BY TURNING ON LIGHT MASTER BEDROOM"</p>

<p>  timer (cron: 0 30-45 6 ? * 2-6)</p>

<p>when eval(true) </p>

<p> Event( source == "Status - Lys - 2 etg - Master Bedroom - Morgenlys", value == "on" )</p>

<p>then</p>

<p>  execute.command("Lys - Dimming - 2 etg - Master Bedroom (UP)", 1);</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>I altered the time settings from timer (cron: 0 30-45 6 ? * 2-6) to   timer (cron: 0 28-45 19 ? * 2-6).... but nothing happens.<br/>
Since the rule has been working I know there is nothing wrong with my rule, and changing the time should not have any impact.</p>

<p>I have tried looking in the log, checking if the rule file has been updated, restarted the controller and even restarted my synology server, but still, it is not working..</p>

<p>HELP?!?!?!</p>
