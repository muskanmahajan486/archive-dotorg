				    <p>I am having a terrible time getting Linux 64bit/zwave/DSC combination to work with Openremote.  I installed Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit server and my DSC alarm setup sent smooth.  I then spent a long time trying to figure out how to get my Z-Stick to work and eventually replaced my txrxSerial, sorry I can't remember the file right now, with the 64 bit version and my z-wave started and created the zwave.log file.  The problem is my DSC alarm no longer works unless I go back to the 32 bit txrx file.  Is this just a reality for Openremote and 64 bit?  Will I really need to install older 32 bit tech to make this work?</p>

I have also installed the librxtx-java package in Ubuntu, from the 64-bit repositories. The current version is 2.2pre2-11. This works with Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10. In the transition to 64-bit I sometimes were out-of luck with the rxtx that came with Ubuntu. I then resolved the issue by downloading and installing my own rxtx. You will find posts on this forum about that. </p>

<p>Note that rxtx needs a java API, that is the jarfile. It also needs a dynamic library, for Linux this is librxtx-Serial-2.2-pre1.so. The dynamic library need to match your architecture, 32-bit or 64-bit. </p></font>
