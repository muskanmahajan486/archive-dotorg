				    <p>I recently have jumped back into openremote after being away from the design stage for over a year. Upon trying to design a new screen, I've noticed that my uploaded image names don't seem to match the correct image. The image is named one thing but shows a completely different image in the image quick view as well as on the screen. If I upload a new image, it works as expected but when I go to select that same image again, it is a completely different image but named the same as the one I uploaded.</p>

<p>I'm still running version 2.0 so I'm not sure if that is an issue or not? I'm running 2.0 because I don't completely remember how I got it working on a Win 7 box in the first place. I remember having to do a bunch of customization in order to get things working (tomcat install as well as editing a bunch of files) and when I try to use version 2.1 things just don't work at all. I'm guessing I have to figure out all the files I changed and change them again... kind of a pain to do.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on why this image thing is happening? I tried searching the forums but did not find a similar issue.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi.</p>

<p>Long time since I have added something to my project. This has happned to me as well. I have removed one panel as I have replaced my H/W and sotarted adding a new one identical to the others but with different resolution.<br/>
I have a gree button and red one with dew sizes and unique names.<br/>
All of a sudden, the list of exitinf images is much shorter then what is realy being used, selecting an image of of my disk is not being remembered and when I try to use an exiting image of a button to be attached to a switch I get a different iamge (one being used as the screen background).<br/>
It looks like the DB of the images has a bug.<br/>
I am still in the designed, running under Linux MINT 17 and Google Chrome.<br/>
Can't get the job done.</p></font>

Sorry for the delay but the solution is to re-sort the images (as ICT states). Not really all that convenient but it does fix the issue (but you have to do it every time).</p>

<p>Windows 8.1 and had this happen in version 2.1.0 and 2.2.0.</p>

<p>And Chrome Version 40.0.2214.115 m</p>

<p>Can't attach but can point to it:</p>

Furthermore, when opening the add image button for getting a new image, the parent popup window is in the background. The only way to upload a new image from my disk is to close the parent windows, otherwise, the child (image upload) is greyed out and can not be selected.<br/>
