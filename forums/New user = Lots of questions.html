				    <p>Hey guys.  I'm looking into using Open Remote as a replacement for my current HA software Homeseer.  I currently am running Homeseer home automation software with interfaces for X10 devices (Using CM11A controller)  as well as a Trane  TZEMT400AB32MAA Zwave thermostat (Using Aeon Labs USB Stick). I would like to use a Raspberry PI as my Open Remote machine/server.  Can both of these interfaces be used with the RP?  I know that the CM11A would need a serial-to-usb adapter.</p>

<p>I installed Open Remote on my Windows machine to take a look at the UI.  I think the set up of the X10 and Zwave intefaces is pretty straightforward, but I didn't see much by way of example on setting up the X10 devices or the thermostats on the Open Remote homepage.  I'm pretty sure I'm just overlooking it and would appreciate a push in the right direction.</p>

<p>Currently, I have Homeseer controlling various lights triggered by motion detectors as well as X10 keypads.  I also have certain lights turning on and off at certain times (eg on at dusk off at dawn).  I can also control my thermostat using an X10 keypad (eg up/down one degree).  Can these type of 'events' be created in Open Remote?  If so, can someone point me at examples for creating these type of events?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>It will require a Linux machine though. The cross-platform implementation for X10 as it currently stands is for sending commands only.</p>

<p>If you're successful with mochad, we'd be interested to know so we can also document the steps on this site.</p>
