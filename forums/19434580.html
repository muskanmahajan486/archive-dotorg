<p> Hello everyone <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>


<p>I'm new to openremote, I'm evaluating it as an alternative to stardraw control.</p>

<p>I'm probably missing something really obvious, but is there a repository of device codes anywhere, or a hardware compatibility list (HCL)? We have a bunch of projectors and other kit that we'd like to control and I wanted to see if they were supported already or not, i.e. how much work it would be to get up and running with openremote. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Will</p>

For native support, if you look at the protocol that can be used when creating a new command using the on-line modeler, this should give you the complete list.<br/>
There is not much A/V device native support in there, either you should use IR, either it can works over a "standard" UDP/TCP/HTTP/Telnet protocol, either you need to implement a new protocol.<br/>
For IR, if you do a "Import IR Commands" in the on-line designer, you'll see the full list of currently supported IR codes.<br/>
If you have IR codes that needs to be added, you can always post on the forum and we'll see how we can have them added to the database.<br/>
Also, if you need support for native protocol for other device, the best is always to post on the forums, so if there is interest from the community, it might encourage somebody to implement it.</p></font>
