				    <p>I read the 2010 article <a href="http://openremote.org/display/docs/Future+Trends+in+Home+Automation">Future Trends in Home Automation</a> by Juha and find it really interesting.</p>

<p>I've been using OpenRemote for a year now together with the Global Cache iTach WF2IR with IR-emitters to control TV, Receiver, Mac Mini (<a href="http://www.sysadminlab.net/other/part-1-how-to-remote-control-ir-devices-with-itach-wf2ir-iphoneandroid-openremote">HOWTO</a>) and a RF-transmitter to control simple lighting using Nexa system (<a href="http://www.sysadminlab.net/other/part-2-how-to-turn-lights-onoff-using-an-iphoneandroid-openremote-itach-wf2ir-and-nexa">HOWTO</a>). Next step is to get a Samsung TV which you can control over IP (<a href="http://openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Samsung+TV+Remote">HOWTO</a>). Pretty simple stuff. Time to take it to the next level!</p>

<p>Now I want to start controlling more <b>lights</b> in the house with something that is not based on Nexa since I want to increase distance between the transmitter and device I'm controlling.</p>

<p>So my question for OpenRemote users is: Which system should you get for controlling lights (for Europe or more exactly Sweden)? I've seen X10 but I guess there are more affordable and more <em>open</em> systems nowadays? My demands are mostly on/off/dimmers. I'm no developer but I've succeeded so far with the help in these great forums!</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

If you want to run cable the most solid (but also most expensive) solution would be KNX. X10 is a powerline technology and I heard some issues regarding stability and also there is no feedback if the command reached the lamp. There exist a couple of wireless solution where Z-Wave seems to be most promising. Alternatives are Zigbee and KNX RF.</p></font>

<p>Anyone worked with <b>Z-Wave/Zigbee/KNX RF</b> and can tell us pros and cons? I guess from an OpenRemote standpoint - all of them work? Nexa, which I use today, use RF, but for that the distance is quite limited and there's no feedback, maybe KNX RF has feedback?</p></font>

<p>Z-Wave, Zigbee and KNX RF all have feedback. KNX RF is the most expensive version but offers a lot especially if you later want to extend and you would be able to run some wires. They offer gateways to link KNX RF to KNX TP. Zigbee has the problem that it is a standard but only on a lower level which means not all devices can communicate with each other. </p>

<p>Z-Wave already offers a lot devices and they can talk with each other. Mains powered devices act as a repeater to be able to communicate on bigger distances.</p>

<p>Another RF protocol coming up is ENOCEAN and somebody is already working on OpenRemote integrations.</p></font>

<p>Pricewise - where do they all stand? If we start with the basic on/off/dimmers.</p>

<p>I guess there should be some "open source" alternatives coming up since there seems to be a lot of DIY solutions coming in the effects or Arduino/Raspberry PI etc. But I guess when it comes to controlling electricity and the actual <b>hardware</b> for it, I guess they face the problem that they need to get <em>certified</em> which might stop some of the projects to become more than a hobby? Or do you see some interesting projects for this? I just looked at panStamp for example.</p></font>

<p>Powerline &#8211; one alternative is Insteon. Popular in US but has taken them years and years and years to get to EU. According to some statements (<a href="https://plus.google.com/115276635808939260873/posts/W17cjKVDT3H">https://plus.google.com/115276635808939260873/posts/W17cjKVDT3H</a>) they're now in Europe but fair to say they're not well established yet here even they have good reputation in US. They're similar to X10 but with most of the protocol/reliability problems fixed. Depends on your nature if you prefer something established or like to try new things which may require more effort or little more risk.</p>

<p>If wireless then Z-wave is the established technology to go with. Downside is that it is completely proprietary so you're going to be stuck with whatever happens with the technology with little control of your own. There are many 'open' alternatives to Z-wave but none of them have been able to build the momentum &#8211; technically most of them are probably better alternatives to Z-wave but again depends on your nature if you prefer something established or want to work/risk something with more difficult to find and more work required. If one of the open wireless options ever pan out (and there are indeed many candidates) I think Z-wave will quickly lose attractiveness given the current licensing model they have. On the plus side wireless equipment is easy to replace although you do lose the money invested of course. But at least you're not ripping cables out of the walls in that case.</p>

I really prefer Open Source solutions over proprietary but sometime you just have to bite the dust and go proprietary just because for me (as a non-developer) open source can sometimes be a little bit too hard to grasp but OpenRemote has really proved that open source can work (much thanks to the forums).</p>

<p>Are there any specific open source project that you would suggest me to look into if I don't mind the extra work?</p>

<p>For old-fashioned 220V lighting I'm not aware of any to recommend (short of something where you build everything from scratch yourself) mostly due to the liabilities involved with distribution of dangerous voltage, what you mentioned before.</p>

<p>So on Open Source lighting side the options come down to low-voltage and LED lighting.</p>

<p>Daniel's <a href="http://www.panstamp.com/">panStamp</a> is one option there, checking the <a href="http://www.panstamp.com/store">store</a> there's an 10A/10V output actuator for example: <a href="http://www.panstamp.com/products/output-board">http://www.panstamp.com/products/output-board</a></p>

<p>Another option is <a href="http://freaklabs.org/">Akiba's Freaklabs</a> which is Zigbee-based IIRC. There are some LED related items <a href="http://www.freaklabsstore.com/">in the store</a>, although in both cases will depend a bit on lighting requirements you have (ambient/background/spot) and whether you get enough out of these for your needs.</p>

<p>And to be clear in both cases you'll be well into the research/prototype mission, these are early and not proven yet.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi</p>

<p>May I jump in here?</p>

<p>I have been an avid X10 (advanced) user for some years now, and eventually took the plunge to get rid of it all for a number of reasons. 1). Reliability. 2). Its now obsolete.</p>

<p>So I looked around a lot at all of the Open &amp; affordable systems like Z-Wave, Lutron, KNX, Helvar and so forth.</p>

<p>Eventually I stumbled on something new and currently (I think) only available in the UK. It's called LightwaveRF. It's not Powerline, it's RF, but it's mega reliable and really cheap (as an example the Switches come in a 3-pack with a Remote for just £35. The box that holds all of the sequences and timers and allows WAN access on an Android or iPhone is only £70.</p>

<p>What made this really favourite for me was when I contacted the nice people at LightwaveRF (a company called JSJS Designs) and asked them for the API, they sent it straight over. So now I have OpenRemote controlling my Lights and Appliances from my iPhone, Android Tablets and iPad and i have been able to build the mood control of the lights into my Home Theatre pages of my OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Unfortunately though I started a task to program OpenRemote to include the LightwaveRF Protocol so that instead of just sending UDP packets from OpenRemote, I would be able to properly integrate a bi-directional protocol with Sensors and Switches (etc).... but I have not had the time to progress this much yet <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Anyway.... sorry for jumping in, just wanted to share my delights at this new technology (and no, I don;t work for them <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>)</p></font>

<p>It almost sounds like the Nexa solution found in Sweden that also uses RF, but LightwaveRF seems to be on steroids <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>.

<p>What is the distance like?<br/>
What sends the actual RF-command? Do you have the Wifi Link device which you send the command to from the Open Remote Controller?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Jonas</p>

<p>The Range is surprisingly good - and you can also get Range Boosters for about £20 if you have a problem. I have a large 4-bed house and external double garage and it works all over - including outside.</p>

<p>Yes, your are right, I was talking about what they refer to as the WiFi box.</p>

<p>There is a Software update coming out in September that will lift some of the memory restrictions around only having 10 timers and 10 sequences, and I believe there are more devices coming out also.</p>

<p>What makes this system different from any of the Home Automation competitors is that you can buy it mainstream - i.e. we have a high street DIY shop in the UK called B&amp;Q, and we have an online Tooling shop called Screwfix and you can buy LightwaveRF from both of these places (in fact the LightwaveRf from B&amp;Q are actually badged as Siemens).... so these are really coming to consumers and not just geeks like us now.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hej Jonas,</p>

<p>thank you for writing down your thoughts, experiences, and questions. As you seem to be aware, there are several other systems essentially identical to "your" Nexa. I downloaded some "IR-codes" ("Nexia with switch code") from sydia.se and it turned out to be the well known codes used e.g. by Intertechno. Here in Germany, Intertechno are fairly common, "identical", at least in the sense of using identical codes, to products sold under names Düwi, One-for-all, ELRO, and probably more that I am not aware of. I am using a fairly large number of Intertechno switches myself, and the reliablity is OK. A slightly better, slightly more expensive system (but still "cheap") is FS20, using 868MHz frequency, thus less sensitive for disturbances from headless earphones and babyphones. It also has some smart dimming facilities: My good-nite macro turns my bedroom lights to 50%, and then dims it down to 0 over 5 minutes <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>.</p>

<p>To control them, I use a T-10 from <a href="http://www.ezcontrol.de">http://www.ezcontrol.de</a> (now discontinued and replaced by the successor XS-1 model). This sends the RF signals (to Intertechno/Nexa/FS20,... ) directly from ethernet, using http interface, or UDP (just T-10, not XS-1). (I think there has been at least one thread about it.) Subjectively, this appears to work more reliable than the GlobalCache + IR-&gt;RF solution. As Swedish alternative to Ezcontrol is Telldus Tellstick, available both as USB version and for ethernet. (There has been some threads in the Eventghost forum.)</p>

<p>BTW, you should have a look at my program IrMaster, <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/irmaster.html">http://www.harctoolbox.org/irmaster.html</a>, Among other things, you can generate all the "codewheel" signals for Intertechno/Nexa by selecting the "Intertechno" protocol, D for house code, S for device address, and F=1 for on, F=0 for off.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Bengt,</p>

<p>Interesting thoughts! I've spent some time investigating more professional alternatives like z-wave but in the end they turn out to be pretty expensive, that's why I started this thread <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>There are two alternatives at <a href="http://www.nexa.se/">Nexa</a> (sorry their page is in Swedish only): <b>System Nexa (433 Mhz)</b> and <b>Nexa Professional (868 MHz)</b> where Nexa Professional seem to have more wall mounted switches etc (<a href="http://www.nexa.se/Nexa-professional.htm">here</a>). If I would get the 868 MHz (Nexus Professional) I guess I would need that Telldus to send signals since the one I have now only does 433 MHz (or the Ezcontrol XS-1 if I can get hold of one in Sweden), but the Telldus is pretty affordable at just less than 100eur but I don't know about the feature differences.</p>

<p>What is the range of the 868 MHz RF signals? I feel that the 433 MHz is not that good.</p>

<p>And thanks for IrMaster! Perfect so I don't need to contact Sydia each time I need codes <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

<p>Thanks For your post. I'm thinking of using RFTtrx433 for lightwaverf control using a rasp pi and open remote. Are you using the same USB device or similar setup?</p>
