				    <p>Not to start a flamewar, but I was wondering if anyone on the dev team has considered using Git rather than SVN?  I'm just checking out the codebase now.  </p>

<p>I switched to a distributed SCM about a year ago and <b>love it</b>.  It makes hacking on other people's code much easier - for instance I could just clone your repo, make a few development branches to play with locally, commit my changes and then if you guys wanted to incorporate my code you could just merge in my changesets.</p>

<p>I'll probably end up using the git-svn plugin to do just that, but I thought I'd make the suggestion...  <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>That's true.  I started with Mercurial - it's pretty nice.  I forced myself to learn Git 'cause I was using a lot of stuff hosted on github (which ROCKS btw), and I think I like it a lot better.  The biggest difference is that Mercurial encourages forking through clones (make a new repo in a different location) while Git encourages branching (all in the same directory), and I really prefer the branch approach.  Git also seems to have better support for monkeying with how commits are combined (rebasing and all).</p>

<p>Anyway, just about to start poking through the code, cant wait!</p>
