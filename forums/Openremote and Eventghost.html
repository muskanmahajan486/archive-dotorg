				    <p>I just discovered Openremote and it seems to have all I was looking for:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>free / not expensive</li>
	<li>clients for both android and ios (Ipad)</li>
	<li>support for two-way communication and displaying "sensors" in the GUI</li>
	<li>design-software for creating panels</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, I do find the learning curve to be extremely steep. I have been able to create a panel on my Ipad, add a button to it and sent an UDP-event to Eventghost which is running on a laptop. I would now like to send (back) an event from eventghost with a payload. The payload-value should be displayed on the Ipad. Once I get this working I might do just about anything because the possibilities of eventghost are endless.</p>

<p>I suppose UDP or TCP or whatever could be used but has anyone either done this already or can anyone give me directions on how to proceed?</p>

<p>thanks a lot in advance!</p>

Steps to get this working would be:<br/>
1) create one command which sends TCP todo some action<br/>
2) link this command to a button</p>

<p>3) create one command which sends TCP to receive some payload<br/>
4) create a custom sensor and link the command which is receiving the payload<br/>
5) use a label and link to the custom sensor to display the payload</p>

<p>You don't necessary need the "action" command and the button. Only the status command and the sensor is enough if you just want to display information.</p></font>

<p>The problem I see is that EventGhost Network Event receiver is expecting a handshake dialog with the sender (OpenRemote in this case). So rather than just being able to throw TCPIP text at a socket, EventGhost wants to exchange a cookie and accept passwords etc before you can throw a payload at the connection to trigger an event.</p>

<p>Is there an easier way?</p>

<p>I really just want to throw simple text at EventGhost and get it to respond as if my OpenRemote was a keyboard.</p>

<p>thanks in advance....</p></font>
