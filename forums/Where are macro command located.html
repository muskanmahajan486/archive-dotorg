				    <p>Dear all<br/>
Firstly, happy new year to everybody.<br/>
I have maybe a stupid question, but I couldn't find where the macro scripts are stored on the server.</p>

<p>I have created a macro, it works fine.<br/>
Now I just want to run it from a KNX switch.</p>

<p>I learned that I cannot run a macro from a rules, and that i cant just copy the macro inside the rule.</p>

<p>To do this more quickly, I wanted to just copy the sequence from the macro file ( or ref : XML ?..)<br/>
This also because I add some delay between commands, and that they will be long and multiples in future.</p>

<p>Did someone can tell me where i can find the macro file on my server ?</p>

<p>Some additional information, I didn't succeed anyway with the rules.<br/>
Even if a simple rule in well written in the designer UI ( and retrieved after log off, log on ), the file modelers_rules.drl is overwritten by a blank file on my server each time I synchronize the controller.</p>

<p>I tried to edit the drl file directly on the controller, and then to restart it, but then nothing works at all..</p>


<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Philippe</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for this quick answer.<br/>
I should then consider to rewrite the macro as rule.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I would like to know (for my background) how and where it is stored, if someone knows.</p>

<p>Also, I still have the mystery the rules files which is overwritten by a blank file during synchronization.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Regarding where the macro are stored, not sure if you're asking on the controller or in the designer.<br/>
On the controller, macros do not exist. When a macro is linked to e.g. a button, all the commands that make up the macro are linked to the button.<br/>
On the designer/beehive, macro definitions are stored in the SQL database.</p>

<p>Regarding rules file, are the rules correctly stored in the designer ? I mean if you logout and log back in, do you still see the rules you defined ?<br/>
If not, it might be because you forget to click on "Submit".<br/>
If they are stored, then I'm not sure what could cause the issue of the rules file being empty.<br/>
Might be worth downloading the zip file from the designer and checking it the file is empty or not in there.</p></font>

Tks for answer. <br/>
For info, my basic question was about the macro on the controller. It remains a little bit a mystery, but it doesn't really matter. My question was in fact "can I re-use this, or not". The answer is not. That's it.</p>

<p>For the rules, I just quickly tried to download the zip file, and the rule file is the good one (same as on designer)</p>

<p>I will probably not have access to the controller for a few days, I will try later again there.<br/>
As first time , I think I could have been related to a write access, but this is not the case, as the existing file is really overwritten by a blank one.</p>

<p>I will let the community know if I don't find (for support...) or if I found why it didn't work.</p></font>
