				    <p>Hello,<br/>
Just wondering.<br/>
So far pretty much everything is working fine with my z-wave dimmer + OpenRemote.<br/>
Just one thing that's annoying, but don't know if I may have missed something or not.</p>

<p>When I turn on/off/dim my light from my iPhone/webconsole all is well. Range sensor, on/off sensor and light all act as normal.<br/>
But when I turn on/off the light from the actual switch, the iPhone's display isn't updated.<br/>
zwave.log file doesn't show any activity when turning on the light directly from the switch.</p>

<p>If I turn on the light from the switch and restart the server, the information displayed on my phone (and webconsole) is updated.</p>

<p>Everything works fine when either using zwave.me thing and the Homesear application. As in when using the switch, it's represented in<br/>
their respective applicaitons.</p>

<p>Using the Evolve LRM-AS Dimmer switch if that can help anyone...</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

				    
                                            <div class="tabletitle">
                            <a name="comments">Comments:</a>
                        </div>

                        <table border="0" width="100%">
                                                        <tr>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>This is kind of a bummer. It's like the sensor isn't working.<br/>
Even had a rule printing the sensor's status, either on/off to screen. If the light is off when I start up the server, it will print 'off' but won't print 'on' when I turn on the light using the switch. If I leave the light on, restart the server it then prints 'on'.</p>

<p>Hope I'm making sense here :S</p></font>

Do you test on a physical iPhone, or on a virtual iPhone via Webconsole? In the latter case I have a possibly similar issue in Webconsole which seems to be related with using the same image for multiple button's. The previous version of Webconsole did not have that problem.</p></font>

When using HomeSeer I noticed my ZStick's light is continuously flashing, that could be what it's doing.</p>

<p>So Z-Wave devices natively don't send back their status when using the physical button?<br/>
From and end-user standpoint, how could I get OpenRemote to poll the device on a regular basis? Pretty sure rules won't help seeing it's not getting the correct status.<br/>
Not a neat workaround, but if the device isn't sending it's status I don't see another option.<br/>
Too bad I'm not too comfortable with Java, or I'd look into this more.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>@Marcus, I guess what you describe is the default behaviour of a zwave device. My Zwave.me switches do send a status change on manual switching. In that respect they do differ from the standard Duwi switches (<a href="http://en.z-wave.me/content/flush-mountable-switch-dimmer-and-blind-control">http://en.z-wave.me/content/flush-mountable-switch-dimmer-and-blind-control</a>). </p>

<p>Side note: At the time I started with zwave I had one switch if pressed switched on two or three others, but a zwave command did not. Did take me a while to find out that the strange behaviour was due to the fact that for some reason this one switch had been accidentilly associated with the others. </p>

<p>Additional note: I don't know if you do this, but I guess at start up the controller should request all zwave devices to report their status.<br/>

I think any good contrallable device should do that <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Everything else just creates communucation traffic which can be avoided.<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>@pe zanstra:<br/>
So my dimmer switch doesn't send it's status. Unless I'm missing a configuration.<br/>
I've re-checked my dimmer's behaviour when using z-wave.me.The webapp does get updated when using the physical button, but it takes a few seconds.<br/>
The ZStick's light indicator doesn't flicker when I press the button. As with HomeSeer, the ZStick2's light indicator does flicker on a regular basis. <br/>
Which leads me to believe it's polling the device.</p>

<p>-What manufacturer would you suggest I look into? (I live in Canada) As in a manufacturer/device that does send it's status change after using the physical button.</p>

<p>-And if I do find a device that does send it status, will OpenRemote catch/receive this status change?</p>

<p>(I won't go into receptacles/wall sockets just yet lol)</p></font>

	<li>The light indicator does not flicker. It does not visibly change either if I push a switch.</li>
	<li>I have no insight in what individual Z-Wave devices report in terms op statuses. Also I do not know of any sources that systematically report Z-wave device capabilities. A source that I use is the "Pepper One" database (<a href="http://www.pepper1.net/zwavedb/">http://www.pepper1.net/zwavedb/</a>), but they do not report about statuses being sent under certain conditions.</li>
	<li>As Webconsole (which at the moment has a flaw in rendering my button's) is my only interface, I can not properly test response to actions. As a preliminary conclusion I can say it seems to react more or less as Zwave.me reacts to changes.</li>

<p>I am sorry I can't offer you more help. On an other place on this forum I have avocated the need for developing a more complete formal ontology for devices. The Z-Wave alliance seems not very strong on that theme unfortunately.</p></font>

<p>Ok then, so no real info on which Z-Wave stuff (switches/dimmers/receptacles/etc) send out their status when physically used is my understanding.</p>

<p>Right now I'm running OpenRemote on an Ubuntu Server 12.04 using the Aeon Labs Z-stick 2.<br/>
As far as Z-Wave devices go I only have the one so far (Evolve LRM-AS Dimmer switch). <br/>
And as mentioned, when using z-wave.me my stick does flicker about every minute. And that's when the light's status chances on the webpage.</p>

<p>Currently looking through specs from different manufacturers to see if there are any indications it sends out a status changed when used.<br/>
So far nothing conclusive or concrete (bummer). <br/>
The only thing remotely relevant would be the Vizia-RF series by Leviton which mentions "Two-way communication". But that could mean anything really.</p>

<p>Well thanks for the help PE, starting to wonder if OpenRemote is the way to go for me now.</p>

At the moment my bet is that ultimately will deliver what I need as an open framework for home control (and fun I must admit).<br/>

Within that system I recently noticed many "re-send" activities in the logs, which I hold responsible for lower responsivity of my switches. (I suspect a recently added Everspring SF812 smoke detector responsible for this change in behaviour).<br/>
So I think having this Status command available would be very usefull.</p>

<p>Update: The default setting of Zwave&gt;Me does also include a weekly scheduled battery status update.</p></font>

So hopefully sooner, rather than later, we'll have that sensor get function to re-poll devices using rules.</p>

I'm hoping to add a few switches/dimmers and receptacles soon.</p></font>

<p>OpenZwave seems to receive a notification update that is placed on the zwave network.</p>

<p>I have tested this both with changing the value of a switch with the application and manually.</p>

<p>However, this may just be due to a difference in means by which OpenZwave implements the zwave protocol and the methods exposed via the JARs in OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Will post more once I look into the OpenZwave code more to see if the code is actually just polling the devices.</p></font>

But the "z-wave.me/expert" page "Device Control/Switches" will not get updated either.<br/>
Some times the phone is correct, some times the "expert" gui is correct.</p>

<p>But if there is a difference it seems like the button "Update" actually fixes the status of the dimmer on the phone.<br/>
What command is there behind the buttom "Update" I would like to use that in Open Remote as a rule or as a status-command.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows if you can trigger "Update" manually from Open Remote?</p></font>

<p>the switch never send it status to the controller that lead me to use the rules. The rule check for the status of the switch every 5 seconds.</p>

<p>there are a few things that i have to test before i can say that it work flawless but at this moment is working.</p>

<p>why are you using the z-wave.me.  there is any advantage over the OR controller?</p>

<p>If this help my hardware is: z-tick, aotec micro smart switch, Openremote running on a windows laptop and java 6</p>

<p>My guinea pig to the the user interface is Samsung Galaxy III</p>

<p>When I finish all the test of the z-wave devices i will this to post my experience.  that will include the switch and dimmers.</p></font>
