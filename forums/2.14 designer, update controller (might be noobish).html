				    <p>In one of the threads i saw mention of a 2.14 designer that included a webview and colour picker. These are of big interest to me as i couldn't really achieve what i wanted to do without such items.<br/>
I notice the lastest controller download is 2.02 though. Do these need to match or can i happily design in 2.14 and having it work with the 2.02 controller?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Edit - Also, what about the app? Latest iOS is 2.13, do i need to wait for 2.14 before i can use web views?</p>



<p>Edit2 - I tried using the preview designer (markab) and using the online preview on my iPad. It didn't work, it just said "no group found". So i went back to rosemary and all my settings had been wiped. On returning to markab my settings had been wiped there too.<br/>
What is going on?</p>

<p>Edit3 -online preview works on iPhone 4S and android but not on ipad2, there is no option to select panel identity. My previous work (not much, can redo it) is still missing though, would be a big issue for someone with some serious work done</p>

<p>You will need the 2.1 Developer Release available here: <a href="http://download.openremote.org/2.1-DeveloperRelease">http://download.openremote.org/2.1-DeveloperRelease</a></p>

<p>XBMC json rpc seems to be broken though. Followed the tutorial exactly and nothing. I'm able to use other json remotes so i know xbmc is set up correctly. Is this a known problem?</p></font>

<p>Would highly appreciate if someone would be able to go through that sprawling thread and come up with coherent steps of what needs to be changed (if anything) in the a) documentation b) controller c) designer.</p>

That was added in ORCJAVA-260.<br/>
And the designer needs to allow to set that attribute for HTTP protocol (currently in Pro only).<br/>
Add this to the documentation (XBMC How-to and HTTP How-to).</p></font>

<p>This isn't a long term solution but until the software can be updated i have found that using a GET instead of a POST works well.<br/>
You have to have the entire URL including params in the URL field, this is an example of one of mine:</p>

<p><a href="http://192.168.0.105:80/jsonrpc?request=">http://192.168.0.105:80/jsonrpc?request=</a>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Input.Up", "id": 1}</p></font>

You should select your controller (it should auto-discover, though sometimes that fails and you have to enter manually).<br/>
Once a controller is selected, you should select the panel you want to display.<br/>
Then clicking done to exit preferences should bring you to your UI.</p></font>
