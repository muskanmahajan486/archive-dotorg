				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have bought for me and my wife 2 openremote KNX 1.4.2 application for iphone (me) and ipad (my wife). Is there some plan to move this application on Ipad format ?</p>

<p>After, may be this question will look crazy but I don't see the difference between openremote knx, openremote boss and openremote console...</p>

<p>I went throught docs but this is still not clear to me what is doing what</p>

<p>Thank you for helping me</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Thierry</p>

<p>yeah nomenclature is still a struggle.</p>

<p>Basically <br/>
OR KNX is the application iphone that you got, no controller</p>

<p>OR with ORB (formally known as BOSS) has a controller</p>

<p>the designer/console is to define your panels, it is based on the controller one. </p>

<p>We are working on merging the two, so you can use the designer.  Still alpha. </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks a lot for this very fast answer.</p>

<p>I'm interested in having the possibility to "customize" a bit more Openremote KNX which is working very well but would be nice with more possibility of customization.</p>

<p>I would be also interested in having openremote controler (if I have well understood) working on a NAS such as synology ( I have 2 syno at home <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>)</p>

<p>And last but not least, as french guy, I can help on translation if you want (I have seen some french mistakes in openremote KNX), if you send me english wording, I can translate into french.</p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Thierry</p></font>
