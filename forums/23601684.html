				    <p>Hi,<br/>
Is it possible to use a IR 3.5mm dongle in the headphone jack with openremote? If it's possible how do I configure that?</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

Ah ok thanks for your reply. <br/>
So is it because openremote just don't support it or is it not doable at all? I know that some apps on google play supports the use of IR 3.5mm dongles. But I guess I need to get irtrans or some other device then. <br/>
Do you know if irtrans and other IR devices needs to be in line of site of the things it will control in order to work?</p></font>

Irtrans is pretty strong. You can have it point sideways and it would still reach <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

<p>That sounds indeed promising, do you have one yourself? Can it control more than 1 device at the same time, like both TV and Receiver? And what if someone walks in front of the TV/Receiver when I issue the command with irtrans, will it still turn on the device or will it be interrupted? </p>

<p>I ask because I have a really bad experience with my Logitech Harmony that was very sensitive to line of site. If someone walked by the tv it was interrupted and couldn't start it. Or if I "aimed" the Harmony slight from the tv it didn't turn it on either. I don't want to experience that horrible dream again =P </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>By "3.5mm dongle" you probably mean a device suposed  to be fed with wave-"audio" through the earphone jack. Although that can provably be put to work, this is not a technologically sound solution, IMHO. Sacrificing the telephoning and music playing abilities of the smartphone is just one drawback... To fit into the OR client/server architecture, one possibility would be to write a server application that runs on the android device, for example emulating an IrTrans or a GlobalCache. </p>

<p>The line-of-sight problem can be eliminated either by using stick-on emitters (like  
<a href="http://www.smarthome.com/buffalo-electronics-ir-e1-mini-stick-on-ir-emitter.html">http://www.smarthome.com/buffalo-electronics-ir-e1-mini-stick-on-ir-emitter.html</a>) attached to the device just in front of their IR receiver, or using a 3.mm "IR in" input (present on some devices), that can be connected directly to a device like GlobalCache (or IrTrans). That way you can control them individually.</p>

<p>(Before you ask: such an stick-on emitter should not be plugged into the earphone plug of a smartphone.)</p></font>

<p>And I don't agree that it's a draw back. I have a bunch of Android tablets that I have bought to use for different things. I Have one that is only to be used as a remote control for my TV/Receiver and smarthome devices. So using a small device like the one in the link instead is more beneficial than have yet another device that should be put somewhere and that needs power/ethernet calbes and so on. </p>

<p>But thx for your reply, and I guess I have to go with irtrans or something similar. </p></font>
