				    <p>To get all developers enthustiastic about KNX and to allow new ideas and products to arrive markets, you should publish the protocol specifications for everybody to read and evaluate.</p>

<p>The only reason people and companies are usually hiding information or requesting a fee for it, is because the implementation if flawed or does not stand the light (or the critics of wide audience). Or, because they are greed and think they can get the best money by keeping their technology hard to reach. Those are the only reasonings possible to my mind. Natural answers to the questiong - what are you really gaining.</p>

<p>Personally, I hav excellent (20 years) experience from various serial and bus-protocols as an embedded systems specialist and developer-manager and when I saw the first descriptions about KNX I thought it sounds great. Something that even I think might be professionally engineered. However, the lack of openness in standards that are trying to become popular and conquer the world, even at year 2011, makes me sad. It is nothing great. KNX turns into "just another proprietary protocol or system" in the was gray mass of similar things.</p>

<p>Would the protocol specifications be available for free, I myself might be somebody with new and innovative ideas that could help KNX become widespread sooner - and I would be just one among thousands of others all over the world.</p>

<p>Now, lets just see, if KNX can even stand any critics (or new ideas) like this.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Whole-heartedly agree. It's too bad the KNX association cannot make the last mile and distribute the specifications online, and open-source ETS. The market growth is in free access of information and tools. This will make the eco-system boom. The business will follow.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Agreed. I have been asked to investigate the design of a touch button light switch, but finding out the details of the KNX protocol is very hard without coughing up some hard cash. I assume this is how Konnex is funded <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I agree that manufacturers hardware prices are high.  Even the bus interface hardware (TP-UART) is expensive. </p>

<p>It seems to me that this is a bit like the 'EU bureaucracy' culture of impermeable regulations, akin to applying for a European grant of some sort.  If KNX was to penetrate the US then I suspect that things would change.</p>

<p>Edit: I see Konnex is in Brussels. Say no more!</p></font>
