				    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I've been using the online designer for a few months now.  It just started acting up where, if I hit 'save', the pop-up dialog in the lower right says, "500 The call failed on the server; see server log for details time".</p>

<p>It actually saves my changes, in that I can log out and back in, and my changes are there.  However, when I try to update my controller, the update says it succeeds, but my changes are not there.</p>

<p>Any idea why this is happening?</p>

<p>I hit it a few times to get several log times in case the logs are busy, they'll have several areas to look.</p>

<p>All Pacific Standard Time (PST -0800): 12:19:25, 12:19:36, 12:19:43.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Never mind.  I figured it out.</p>

<p>I created a loop in my macros.  I had one macro to call Get on all the lights on 1st floor.  I had another macro to do the same for the 2nd floor.  I had buttons for each, on separate pages with the sliders and switches for their respective floor.  I then thought it'd be nice that, if I click the button for Get on the 1st floor, it do all the 1st floor ones, then do the 2nd floor ones.  And, vice-versa.  Not thinking it through, I went to the 1st floor macro and added the 2nd floor macro as the last item.  I then went to the 2nd floor macro and add the 1st floor macro at the end.  Oops!</p>

<p>It would be nice if we could be alerted to the error or something that would help us narrow down the failure instead of just giving a 500 and pointing to a log that we don't have access to.</p>

<p>I see that people have posted about the 500 error for a few years.  Any thoughts to add more descriptive errors?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></font>
