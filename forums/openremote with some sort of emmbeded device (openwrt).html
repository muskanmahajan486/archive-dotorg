				    <p>Hi all...</p>

<p>I am currently investigating my options in terms of home automation for my self-build home.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of controlling everything from my android phone, and there seems to be great work going on all around this place.</p>

<p>Right now, I am thinking along the lines of using an openwrt based router as my 'always on' control hardware. From this standpoint, it won't really matter how I interface things (I plan on using multiple interfaces eg. 1-wire, custom wireless hardware) as so long I can send commands to the router with openremote, the router will take care of the rest.<br/>
Am I right in thinking if I can muster some sort of tcp/ip based control (ie. telnet) then I don't need a dedicated 'controller' (as I only see x86 hardware based controllers around - correct me if I am wrong)?</p>

<p>As a newb, please correct me if I am confusing things, or mis-using terminology, but my scenario seems plausible enough that someone might have concocted the same idea...</p>

<p>Any input or discussion further surrounding this topic is welcomed...</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
marc_the_kiwi.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Yes, well I think in my context I am looking for something that a 'panel' can directly access without the need for a 'controller', which would mean tcp/ip based protocol or similar.</p>

<p>Again, I am not sure I am using definitions in the right context, so someone please correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>I don't know that an openwrt (or similar) device is something that I want to be running java on... my device is already multi-function file server/etc.. extra load = bad idea.</p>

<p>If I could run some custom telnet server on my openwrt box I think it would be the ideal scenario, as telnet is already supported... unless someone has made use of pre-existing protocols with openwrt already (udp/http)?</p>

<p>Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>


<p>I suppose I am looking for advice on what is currently the best way to implement control without the controller... Advice?</p>

For KNX installations, there is an ORB less iOS application (found in the AppStore) but this does not seem to be what you're after.</p>

<p>The controller is pure Java so can run on many architecture (where a JavaSE 6 VM is available). But if you don't want to put additional load on your OpenWRT box, then you'll need some other device to run the controller on.</p></font>

<p>I might just throw a custom solution together myself then... I'd like to keep my household power consumption to a minimum, and adding another box is something I shouldn't allow myself to do.</p>

If you are willing to do some development on Android, then you could still use OpenRemote for the main part/UI but you will need to develop all the communications module yourself.<br/>
I did experiment with something I called local logic and local sensors a while ago where the code would run on the Android device itself instead of going to the controller.<br/>
You would still need a controller to "load" a new configuration on the panel but then you could use without it.</p>

<p>If you think you want to go this way, let me know and I'll try to dig out what I did and come up with some more information.</p></font>

<p>I basically love the idea of the designer.. but that's only so I don't have to have the learning curve to put together an android app....</p>

<p>I am actually more than likely going to my backup solution (using knowledge I already have). Lightweight http server running on my openwrt box, with some custom cgi to perform the functionality I am after... A webpage will suffice, and if I have a need for a much more sophisticated solution in the future, I know where to come.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your help.</p></font>
