				    <p>I notice that when you create a new device in the Designer, you can easily import the entire list of known commands if the device is IR controlled.</p>

<p>But if the device is supported by non-IR protocols, Denon Serial AVR for example, you have to import the commands one by one. You also have to know the name of the command in order to search for it.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to have an option to "Import all" commands for these protocols. This would make the user experience easier.</p>

<p>Another option would be to have the designer give the user a list of known commands and to have check boxes for the ones that he wants.</p>
