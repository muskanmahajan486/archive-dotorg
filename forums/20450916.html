				    <p>Say i have my controller installed on 192.168.0.5 and a device controlled by TCP on 192.168.0.10.<br/>
If i load up openremote on my iOS device and press a button that initiates a TCP command will this be executed from 192.168.0.5-&gt;192.168.0.10 or would it go iOS -&gt; 192.168.0.10.</p>

<p>I ask, as i want to install the controller on a very underpowered device, which will be ok if it only goes to the controller to sync the panels etc.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for the answer.</p>

<p>In terms of a TCP message do you know if the controller connects to the socket of the receiving device and leaves that connection open for subsequent commands or does it connect/disconnect for each command?<br/>
I've found, admittedly using python, that the socket connection takes quite a lot of time.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The current implementation is very conservative and does close and rebuild the socket every time. Good point about it being a slow operation.</p>

<p>If you need to work around it, you could always do a copy/paste job of the TCP implementation and build a device specific protocol with your own connection management: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Developer+How+To+-+Adding+Your+Own+Protocol+to+OpenRemote+Boss+2.0+Controller" title="Developer How To - Adding Your Own Protocol to OpenRemote Boss 2.0 Controller">Developer How To &#45; Adding Your Own Protocol to OpenRemote Boss 2.0 Controller</a></p>

<p>Also, Richard Turner is extending the current TCP implementation to include some connection management that includes an option to leave a connection open but that's not quite ready for general distribution yet.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>i have an itach that i've been messing around with via my homebrew python web app. I've noticed that opening a connection each time causes significant lag between button press/command send and the resulting IR output from the itach.<br/>
I'll admit, i haven't actually tried it with OpenRemote yet. I'm asking about performance as i'm considering running it on a Raspberry Pi which i've seen has a few success stories and with it being so low powered i figured it could do with all the help it can get.</p>

<p>I'm also considering my own tcp app, but tbh i'll probably stick with HTTP as it works and the performance is quick enough.<br/>
The app basically exposes commands on the host with the aim of controlling a Tellstick and a bunch of RF plug sockets and lights. If OR can execute commands on the host then i could probably do away with it, but i haven't looked into OR's capabilities in enough detail yet.</p>

<p>I guess the best thing to do is actually set it up on the Pi and see how it goes.</p>

<p>I'm a java programmer by trade and i've done some Spring stuff before so i'll check out the DIY protocol stuff when i have a bit more time. Thanks.</p></font>
