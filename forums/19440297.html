				    <p>Hi.  I apologize if this has been covered somewhere else.</p>

<p>I am running Ubuntu 10.10 and am trying to use the Openremote controller.  The controller seems to be running locally, and can sync with the online designer.  (I can access <a href="http://localhost:8080/controller">http://localhost:8080/controller</a> ) However, when I try to reload the controller and clear the cache, I get the following error: "Failed to reload configuration and clear cache!".  The XML files on my server are the ones I created on the designer.   I also tried testing using the "beehive" and could get that to work. </p>

<p>If there is a link to common problems people have had w/ Ubuntu linux I will be happy to reread it.  Also, I am using X10 with the mochad.  The X10 is working with other software I have.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Joe</p>

<p>I had to manually input the default panel name for the controller it detected.  After that, I was able to click on and go to the panel that I had created.  However, clicking on "Reload the controller and clear the cache", does not seem to work w/ my setup.  </p>
