				    <p>I really like the open source idea for home automation! I like the idea of being able to automate of the shelve hardware with different standards. I have an ip relay and I want to make a nice interface with openremote to automate it. The only protocol it supports is snmp. I made a nice interface with the virtual commands and everything looks fine. I can even make buttons that start batch files with snmp commands to set an integer to activate the relay. So far so good. But I can't get the status with the snmp get command via batch files. Is it possible to return a value from a batch file (I get 0 or 1 from the get command) How can I get this 1 or 0 in openremote to change the status of the switch with a sensor. I saw someone started some implementation for snmp protocol in openremote. Can I already use this? The snmp how-to isn't available yet. Im obviously not a programmer so I need some directions on how to use this protocol in openremote. Or maybe via batch files with the get command?</p>

<p>Also another question about the webview. I can't use some webcamstreams because android won't play mjpeg streams. But I managed to get the JPEG visible on my panel. Is there some way to auto refresh this so I get some kind of streaming sensation? </p>

<p>edit:<br/>
I used this webplayer to play my streams and now I can play the streams in the android browser. But in the webview on my panel it still refuses to play. Maybe a problem with javascript?</p>

<p>Any help/directions would be apreciated. </p>

<p>Regards,</p>
