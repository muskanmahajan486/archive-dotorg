				    <p>Hi, I am fairly new to open remote, though have been doing a but of automation for a while now</p>

<p>I am looking to interface with, </p>

<p>Lighting via insteon, <br/>
Home theater systems via, Denon AVR-X  Series recivers over rs232 or HTTP<br/>
a Media server with Samba Shares<br/>
Several media clients, I am looking at the G-Box MX2, running XBMC ( it clames it will do Full 1080p that other versions of xbmc can't<br/>
Paradox sp6000 security system via ???   there is a HTTP interface, but I believe everything that outputs from it is encrypted.    I need only to get updating of zone status<br/>
IP cameras with a NVR<br/>
and Several in wall touch screen controllers ( I am looking at the ones that Homeseer has)</p>

<p>any and all help with the above would be amazing</p>


<p>one thing I am having trouble with is I think I was told previously that openremote does not yet support local com ports, but I did see this on the denon link</p>

<p>QUOTE<br/>
You will also need an RS-232 port on your OpenRemote controller or a suitable IP-&gt;Serial interface (although only limited support is currently available over IP)<br/>
END QUOTE</p>

<p>I know of devices that act as com port servers like the MOXA is a unit like this needed??<br/>
or could I get a much cheaper multi com port card for the computer?<br/>
everything is racked together</p>


<p>Thanks<br/>
-Peter</p>

<p>4-5 Denon AVR-X series Receivers with rs 232 and Network connection (need use of " zone 2 " on the receivers for additional rooms<br/>
Several Insteon Switches/Dimmers/Thermostat/...<br/>
Several Media Clients (one per tv) XBMC I'm thinking<br/>
Interface with Paradox EVO Series alarm for zone updating     I am aware there is nothing currently writen for paradox. the panel will have a com port printer module witch will print zone changes over rs232<br/>
Interface with Jandy Pool Equipment     again I am not sure but assume there is nothing for Jandy aswell.<br/>
several In wall android touch screens as user interfaces (hoping to find one that is POE powered) <br/>
how many Clients can OpenRemote have at once?</p>

<p>If you good people here think this implementation will go together with out too much fuss I and my buddy who does Java will be working on it til the job is done. ( we do have a deadline)</p>

<p>Let me know what you think<br/>

<p>There's no hard limit. In practice it will depend on the hardware/operating system you choose to host the controller in, and how many concurrent threads that environment can support (and ultimately how much memory is made available, since each thread will allocate some memory for its call stack).</p>

<p>10 concurrent control panels should not be an issue with this server.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>As far as I understand these are HTTP requests so several systems is not an issue, they would respond to different IP addresses. It will just be a bit of a pain to click through the designer to configure them all, so make sure to use the "save and continue" option when creating things. Also you'll want to have them all on fixed IP addresses so you don't later need to go back and change things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Same with the Denon AVR stuff, can I have 4-5 of them on the controller all doing there own thing?</p></blockquote>

<p>Not familiar with the Denon implementation, whether it is IP or serial based. I think Eric was saying the Marantz implementation might be close to equal to Denon so in that case at least he might be able to answer on whether multiple units are supported.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the interface with the alarm system, I am aware there is no Paradox alarm yet, but if you think it will interface than I will make it! if any of you can shed some light on these issues please do so.</p></blockquote>

<p>Have no information on how to interface with Paradox (IP?). Anyhow, if you manage to make it would be grateful if you would consider contributing it back to the codebase.</p>

<p>HTH,</p>

But in the current implementation, the definition of the IP address of the AVR is global to the OR controller, so only 1 AVR can be controlled.<br/>
It could be possible to include an IP in the command (this for instance has been done for the Samsung protocol), but it's kind of a patch waiting for the "connectivity layer / gateway" concept that should solve these kind of issues globally.</p>

I of course be offering all new scripts back to the group, that's the point no? <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>any way, any I'm sure I will have more questions as this project comes together, also is it worth it to get a Pro Designer account? I was thinking about the IR import? it could be useful for controlling cable boxes?</p>

<p>I suspect the first iteration of the gateway thing might however be kind of a templating hack that goes over the IP fields of each command and places a default value, that's configured once per gateway. But it quite possibly will rely on the IP field at least to exist in the command implementation of the Java code.</p>

that said, I am currently working on getting rs232 Hex out to a Ashly 24.24m audio matrix<br/>
I am on a Centos Linux box and have been using ttyS0 with putty, my question is in the Designer serial port assignment it asks for a Com port, (WINDOWS) do I sub in /dev/ttys0 ?</p>

<p>thanks<br/>
