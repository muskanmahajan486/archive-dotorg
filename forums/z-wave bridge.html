				    <p>Hi Guys...</p>

<p>great project</p>

<p>I am trying to set a prototype with some z wave switches.</p>

<p>I was looking at these :</p>

<p><a href="http://micasaverde.com/vera.php">http://micasaverde.com/vera.php</a></p>

<p>and </p>

<p>HSC-40 from homescenario</p>

<p>any one tried any of these.. I know the video uses the HSC-40 anyone tried the vera?</p>

<p>Another question on the z-wave integration..</p>

<p>How does openremote work with the other z-wave devices (Ex: Door locks)<br/>
I read that you only support on/off and dimmer for z-wave</p>

<p>How does the IP-zwave bridge handle the different z-wave devices other than the simple on/off</p>

<p>in the case of a door lock you need to enter some numbers to unlock....</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>In the moment we only support the HSC-40 and there only the switch and dimmer.<br/>
Motion detector and window contact which use "basic profile" also work when configured as switch.</p>

<p>We did not try vera yet (they most likely have a different protocol compared to hsc-40).</p>

<p>In the future we will support USB sticks so that OpenRemote can directly talk to z-wave devices where the OpenRemote controller acts as z-wave controller.<br/>
Do you have a special door lock in mind? I would have to check the device profiles to see how the commands are transmitted and to see how the "enter numbers" is transfered.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks Marcus...<br/>
It seems that vera has a little more powerful specs from what I can read (suppots some door locks).</p>

<p>The one I am looking at are the :<br/>
Kwikset Kwikset 910
<a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_SPM3037235402P?mv=rr">http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_SPM3037235402P?mv=rr</a></p>

<p>Also let me understand the process..</p>

<p>The hsc-40 takes http calls that the OR sends it and transforms it to zwave commands?<br/>
Is this how it works?</p>

<p>how hard would it be to implement more complicated stuff like thermostat control and door locks</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The Vera most likely is more powerful then the HSC-40. The HSC only supports basic z-wave command classes in the moment. <br/>
The door lock command class is pretty sophisticated and supports a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>OR sends HTTP commands to the HSC-40, yes, but the status is reported in a rudimentary binary format for which we created some code to be able to give status feedback.<br/>
Unless HSC supports more z-wave command classes and provides a more solid protocol, I doubt we can support door locks.</p>

<p>Supporting door looks with our native z-wave support will be possible but that is a little way down the road. </p></font>

<p>I am researching the Vera at the moment..<br/>
lets say I can send it http commands for turning stuff on and off, and lets say I can send it 1-100 dim parameters. How hard would it be to integrate it with open remote?</p>


<p>The reason I ask is, I want to be able to support a wide range of devices including door locks and thermostats and other z-wave devices..</p>

<p>How do you currently get the status form HSC? by pulling?</p>

<p>Also in earlier post you mentioned native z-wave with USB sticks, can you elaborate on this?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></font>

The HSC is sending the status when something is changed. I need a TCP socket for that to listen to changes.</p>

<p>OpenRemote Inc. (the company behing OR) licensed the z-wave API and we are looking into native z-wave support.<br/>
How that will work and what we will support is not finalized yet. Also how this feature will be integrated is still open since we cannot publish any z-wave API related code.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for the quick reply. I understand the API issue.</p>

<p>For the use case. Ultimately I want to dynamically (based on external parameters) heat different rooms in the house. I imagined that the rules of OpenRemote might be usefull here. The more or less fixed weekly schedules that one finds in thermostats, and the more recent radiator thermostats are to rigid I think. Moreover it seems a waste to me to repeat that functionality many times on every single radiator. Unfortunatly I have not yet found a simple (and cheap) radiator thermostat in which I just can remotely change it's setpoint. <br/>
I cannot yet give any more detail on how to remotely control a "Danfoss Living Connect" as the links I did find are not working. I now found a working link: <a href="http://heating.danfoss.com/PCMPDF/Z_wave_commands_VDFNN202_teamcent.pdf">http://heating.danfoss.com/PCMPDF/Z_wave_commands_VDFNN202_teamcent.pdf</a></p></font>
