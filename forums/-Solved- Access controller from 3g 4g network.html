				    <p> after several attempts to setup remote access of the  Openremote app for andriod . Now is working.</p>


<p>In my case the controller is behind the isp modem and a router which delivers the IP on my network ..</p>

<p>I made a change in the controller port of 8080 to XXXX , configure a dyndns service and did port forward the modem and router</p>

<p>In the application for android (I have a samsung s3 ) to connect outside the local network the address is as follows</p>

<p>http:// &lt;wan address of the controller&gt; : port / controller</p>

<p>to make it work was also needed to go to the designer and change the controller port and this port must be the same in the server.xml file. in my case I change port 8080 because  I did not work for me.</p>

<p>Generally speaking I can say that the lights can turn off and on and it would appear that as if I were on the local network .</p>

<p>I can say that everything I need works fine with Openremote. In my case the controller runs on a computer with windows. I can  control Infrared devices with a  Itach from global cache, program macros, timers etc. and everything works fine. </p>

<p>My next step to acquire the pro version of the designer, my only question is whether the pro version you have a template for the graphics or at least some tools that do not imply that the user will become a specialist in photoshop. </p>


<p>For those doing the numbers I can tell you that putting together a controller capable of handling (the audio and video more lights (vera lite to control lights) cost me 40% less than the cost of a hc-800 control4 controller.</p>

<p>I think This will be my hobby for the rest of the year...</p>
