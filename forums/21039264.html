				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've just discovered OpenRemote and am very happy to have done so <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I have an iTach IP2IR unit and have been looking at apps such as CommandFusion, Roomie, iRule, DemoPad etc.  I currently have an iPhone but don't want to tie myself to an Apple device only solution and also the costs of some of these products is pretty steep (especially if you want more than one RC in some cases).</p>

<p>So as a newbie I'd appreciate some advice on a simple question re. the best platform.</p>

<p>I have a spare Raspberry Pi doing nothing at the moment and I also have a Synology DS411+ NAS.  I've seen that OR will run on either so would like to know what's the best/preferred option.</p>

<p>Also I've seen some discussions regarding the different Java options/versions and specifically comments regarding JIT.</p>

<p>Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Cheers Ian</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Ian,</p>

<p>I have a ds212+ which has an ARM RISC based processor. The install for OpenRemote was not really that straight forward if you do not have a good command as a linux admin. I posted instructions at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21037948&amp;focusedCommentId=21039212#comment-21039212">http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21037948&amp;focusedCommentId=21039212#comment-21039212</a></p>

<p>A good deal of diffculty came from the fact that 212+ is RISC based. I see the DS411+ has an intel processor. Might be much smoother for you..</p>

<p>Anyway, it's humming along now and I don't have any separate devices running. Through the Synology, I'm doing video surveillance, home automation, crashplan backup... So, my goal is utilize the platform as much as possible. The next step for me is to integrate an ethernet IO board for hardwired devices (I don't like batteries <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>).</p>

<p>Good luck,<br/>
Joe</p></font>
