				    <p>Hi!<br/>
As reported in my previous <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/OpenRemote+on+Android+or+customized+Linux?focusedCommentId=22880386#comment-22880386">thread</a>, I'm integrating the OpenWebNet protocol into OpenRemote.</p>

<p>This is my reply to @Marcus to the thread mentioned above:</p>

<p>So is the comment you reported in an old <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/sensors+with+TCP+protocol+problem?focusedCommentId=17039599#comment-17039599">thread</a> no longer correct?</p>

<blockquote><p>Your command has to extend "ReadCommand" and implement ExecutableCommand. <span class="error">&#91;...&#93;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I've already tried in my first test to follow the HTTP implementation, but it didn't work. I'll work more around this and I'll do more attempts.</p>

<p>Anyway, how can I know the type of the sensor I'm handling? I suppose this should be indispensable to set its right value. Do I have to do something like this?</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
<span class="code-keyword">if</span> (sensor <span class="code-keyword">instanceof</span> SwitchSensor)
{
    ...
}
<span class="code-keyword">else</span> <span class="code-keyword">if</span> (sensor <span class="code-keyword">instanceof</span> RangeSensor)
{
    ...
}
<span class="code-keyword">else</span> <span class="code-keyword">if</span> (sensor <span class="code-keyword">instanceof</span> LevelSensor)
{
    ...
}
<span class="code-keyword">else</span>
{
    ....
}
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>(... I didn't find ColorSensor and CustomSensor)</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi,<br/>
yes that thread is over 2 years old and we changed the API.<br/>
New command should implement EventListener interface.<br/>
That interface will "inject" the sensor which is linked to the command.<br/>
Once your command has new information for that sensor all you have todo is</p>
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
mySensor.update(newValue);
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>newValue has to be a String and the sensor will take care to convert it.<br/>
Obviously the command has to set a value which the sensor can convert eg. HTTP command will set the value which is extracted via Regex, Xpath or Json.<br/>
So it's up to the user to define the correct expression for the sensor he wants to use with this command.</p>

<p>If you look at the Vera protocol that might be a good start: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/openremote/code/HEAD/tree/workspace/mredeker/Controller_2_1_0-ORCJAVA-330/src/org/openremote/controller/protocol/vera/">http://sourceforge.net/p/openremote/code/HEAD/tree/workspace/mredeker/Controller_2_1_0-ORCJAVA-330/src/org/openremote/controller/protocol/vera/</a></p></font>

It was only a stupid programming error.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to manage more complex issues, but first I have another question.<br/>
In the dev log, I have two rows like these:</p>
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
2013-11-29 18:11:55,316 INFO [http-bio-8080-exec-6]: Had timeout <span class="code-keyword">for</span> waiting status change.

</pre>
</div></div>
<p>They appear about 1 minute after I sent a command like pushing a button.<br/>
Can I ignore this or could it be dangerous?</p>

<p>This is the complete log file:</p>

I'd like the possible value of some fields depends on that of some others.<br/>

<p>I'm trying to customize the Designer like described above.<br/>
I've created an xml file (similar to  the one contained in the protocol directory) that contains the dynamic values and validators of the protocol fields.<br/>
Now, after analyzing in depth the operation of creating the insertion command form, I'm editing the file DeviceCommandWindow.java, but I'm experiencing some problems to debug my code.</p>

<p>I tryed to use the Logger class (org.apache.log4j) and the LogFacade class (org.openremote.modeler.logging), but when I compile it with ant, I get an error.<br/>
So, at the moment, I'm not able to develop with a functional debug system, and this is very unpleasant!</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions for me?</p></font>

<p>You can use something like Info.debug() call, which is a GXT command that will display a message in a little popup in your browser for basic tracing.<br/>
Or you can set-up GWT in developer mode so that you can have breakpoints and step through your java code in your IDE will running the application. You'll need to google a bit on GWT development or pick up a book on that to know how this can be setup.</p></font>

I used the first solution proposed and it's all right, but now I have another problem.<br/>
I tried to open my xml file from the same class and the compile process fails. I suppose it's because of the same reason of the previous problem.<br/>
How can I fix that?</p>

I analyzed the protocols creation process to take a cue, but I'm stuck.<br/>
In the server side, the ProtocolParser class (org.openremote.modeler.service) takes care to read the contents of every protocol xml files, and it put this into the singleton ProtocolContainer object.<br/>
In the client side, the DeviceCommandWindow class inserts the protocols by means of the createFields method, that has as parameter a map of strings and ProtocolDefinitions. This map is obtained by calling the getInstance static method of the Protocols class (org.openremote.modeler.client.utils).<br/>
Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>The only thing that I didn't understand is how this method works! Can I have some explanation about it?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi!<br/>
As suggested, I used GWT-RPC to do my work. I did it exactly as the implementation to read the protocol xml files.<br/>
It all works except one thing: the first time I open a new (or edit) command window, the function call that returns the file content doesn't run immediately, therefore I haven't the data available in that time, while the subsequent runs work without problems.<br/>
This is false in the protocols case. The instruction:</p>
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
Protocols.getInstance()
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>is executed asynchronously before it actually runs. So the required data are always available.</p>

<p>Why is there this difference, even if the code is basically the same?</p>

<p>This is the function to have the file content:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
   <span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-keyword">static</span> <span class="code-keyword">synchronized</span> Map&lt;<span class="code-object">String</span>, OpenWebNetWho&gt; getInstance()
   {
      <span class="code-keyword">if</span> (instanceMap == <span class="code-keyword">null</span>)
      {
         openWebNetService.getOWNDefinition(<span class="code-keyword">new</span> AsyncCallback&lt;Map&lt;<span class="code-object">String</span>, OpenWebNetWho&gt;&gt;()
         {
            <span class="code-keyword">public</span> void onFailure(Throwable caught)
            {
               MessageBox.info(<span class="code-quote">"Error"</span>, <span class="code-quote">"Can't get OpenWebNet definition from xml file!"</span>, <span class="code-keyword">null</span>);
            }
            <span class="code-keyword">public</span> void onSuccess(Map&lt;<span class="code-object">String</span>, OpenWebNetWho&gt; whos)
            {
               instanceMap = whos;
            }
         });
      }
      <span class="code-keyword">return</span> instanceMap;
   }
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>I could solve this problem in another way, but I would understand that.<br/>
I hope I was clear.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>It also does run asynchronously (which is really the only way as it's making a call to the server and should not block execution for that).<br/>
The "hack" is that Protocols.getInstance() is called at the top of the ApplicationView.initialize() method, so basically before the information is required.<br/>
So that when it's really required, it's already there.</p>

<p>Not a big fan of the way this is done, but it'll work 99.999% of the times (connectivity would need to be behave really weirdly for a user to be able to access the new command window before the initial call to protocols finished).</p>

<p>Other way is to make UI work with asynchronous data source, updating itself as data becomes available.</p></font>

I would have a ComboBox with 4 possible items, but some of these should be hidden or disabled depending on another ComboBox value.<br/>
I was able to do this by removing all the items and reinserting the ones required every time the other ComboBox value changes. Is it possible to avoid this?</p>

thanks for your answer.<br/>
I looked at the code briefly and I see that you use an URL which indicates that you use a BTCINO Webserver ou MH200N which are on the ethernet network.<br/>
Have you already tried your code with an USB dongle (and so a Unix Socket on raspberry)?<br/>
Your code is on designer 2.13.9's branch but is not in the 2.13.9's version that is (as I understand) the current version of the designer. Do you know Why ? </p>

<p>the last but not least <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>, I tried to compile the designer so I could try your code but it failed (JUHA's computer is needed to compile GWT ), is there any way you used to buid your own version of designer ?</p>

<p>Thanks <br/>
Michael</p></font>

<p>1. I tried it only with the ethernet connection.</p>

<p>2. I used Designer 2.14.0 as starting point, as you can read here. I don't known why they have created a 2.13.9's branch in my workspace.</p>

<p>3. At the moment, the only thing that comes to mind is the version of GWT. I have used GWT 2.4.0.</p>

<p>Let me known if you have other problems.</p>

<p>I've been away for a while but I am keen to get Marco's protocol working with the latest version of the controller and the online designer.   Earlier this year I worked with Marco to test the protocol on a standalone designer and controller but could not use this in my live environment because it did not have the DSC alarm protocol.   </p>

<p>From my experience it works well and would be a good addition to OR.  I can test it out but unfortunately I am not a programmer so can't help with the integration.</p>

<p>Cheers<br/>
