				    <p>Newbie alert here. I just got my first IR sent with Open Remote running on iPhone with my <b>Global Cache WF2IR iTach</b> (pressing DOWN on my Apple Remote to control Plex on my MAC Mini). Maybe all this is obvious to some but it took me some research so maybe others will find this helpful and hopefully we can continue this thread on your experiences using WF2IR with OpenRemote.</p>

<p>I started out checking the <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Navigation+Elements">Navigation Tutorial</a> video to figure out the basics to create some buttons. Then go into designer and <b>Building Modeler</b> and choose <b>New &#45;&gt; New Device</b> and name it whatever you like. Then select it and choose <b>New &#45;&gt; New Command</b>. Choose <b>TCP/IP</b> protocol and set the name to the command, I called it "MAC Mini Down". <b>IP-address</b> is the IP of your WF2IR and the <b>Port</b> is 4998.</p>

<p>Then the complicated part, <b>Command</b>, which is not very obvious. For some more technical details, check <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/global+cache+gc-100+setup">this thread</a>. But for me it turned out to be:<br/>
sendir,1:<font color="#ff0000">1</font>,1,37425,1,1,342,171,22,22,22,64,22,64,22,64,22,22,22,64,22,64,22,64,22,64,22,64,22,64,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,64,22,22,22,22,22,64,22,64,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,64,22,22,22,64,22,22,22,64,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,1498,342,85,22,3742</p>


<p>Where the number of the colon (in above example 1 in red) is the output port of the WF2IR which is 1, 2 or 3.</p>

<p>Now how did I figure out the rest? Well, I used <b>ILearn.exe</b>, choosed <b>iTach Learner</b> in the dropbox, put the IP of the iTach and choosed <b>Connect</b>. Then I pointed my Apple Remote towards the iTach and pressed DOWN. I put "DOWN" in the <b>Button Name</b> and pressed <b>Save Data</b>. Keep on doing that for all your commands. <img src="attachments/15532210/15663108.png" align="absmiddle" border="0"/></p>

<p>Then some, probably obvious, stuff. Don't forget to save in Designer, Sync with modeler from your controller and kill the OpenRemote on your iPhone and restart it and it will reload the config.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Is there any way that a single command can be sent to all 3 outputs at once in OR?</p>

<p>For example I have the code:<br/>
(sendir,1:1,1,)37993,(1,1,)124,390,19,171,18,171,19,171,19,85,19,171,19,85,19,86,19,86,19,85,19,86,19,86,18,86,19,86,19,85,19,86,19,171,19,1170,43,385,1,3332,35,3799</p>

<p>In the Elve software I input that code without the data inside the ( ), 37993,124,390,19,171,18,171,19,171,19,85,19,171,19,85,19,86,19,86,19,85,19,86,19,86,18,86,19,86,19,85,19,86,19,171,19,1170,43,385,1,3332,35,3799<br/>
and somehow it sends that command out to all 3 connectors.</p>

<p>I'm about to rearrange my home theater setup and add some new components and it is a huge pain to re-edit every single command's sendir,1:x,1, </p></font>

To make a macro I would have to enter every command three times and then a macro to join them for every button on my remotes, that is hundreds of commands.  I was just wondering if that was something that the iTach could be told to do, or that Elve Home Automation did by it itself.  I'll just have to try and plan out more carefully where everything will go before I edit all the commands again.</p></font>

<p>Have you considered changing the hardware, so that one channel will command several devices? Possibly you can be creative with cheap diodes (1n4148 or the like).</p></font>

That's something I really liked about Elve but, the facts that they don't have Z-stick support and there's been no reply to a question I posted on May 29th, I can't justify paying $99 to hope support is added or somebody replies when I need help. I much rather have to take a few extra steps or try to learn something unfamiliar to me (rules language) and have a growing community to rely on, than have convenience in some areas and be left on my own. </p></font>
