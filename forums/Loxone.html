				    <p>I use the control <a href="http://www.loxone.com" title="Loxone">Loxone</a> Miniserver system as a gateway to many other systems. So it is possible to connect to KNX, enocean, 1-wire, RS-232, but also to connect via http or udp client to other systems is possible. Loxone offers integrated relay cards for direct connection to consumers. The connection to Loxone can be done via http/json or udp.</p>

<p>So this is one of the biggest advantage of this system. Directly connected to KNX or http based Systems and extended with modules for enocean or 1-Wire.</p>

<p>Especially the 1-Wire Connector offers a cheap variation for a Heating control. The Temp Sensor for 1-Wire is around 5 Euro. </p>

<p>At the moment I combine my Ezcontrol R10/T10 with Loxone to control 433 MHZ Temp sensors, and 433 MHZ actors and connect directly from Loxone to my heating valves. Timer control and dependency control ist also made with the Miniserver</p>

<p>Via a configuration Software it is possible to configure many different Tasks and dependencies. The system generates a UI, that can be connected via web/Android/IOS.</p>

<p>I want to open a new Thead to Loxone, since this system indeed generates surfaces from a configuration software, but these are fixed and not as flexible as OR. So OR has the power to extend this smart and flexible sytem.</p>

<p>Has someone already had experience with OR and Loxone?</p>
