				    <p>Dears,</p>

<p>We have just finished an integration project with KNX for a house. We bought the professional license OpenRemote KNX for Iphone version 1.4.2. <br/>
We'd like wo work with the owners different cell phones. We have already tried with one of the phones and would now like to pass it to another of his phones. So we exported the project by using Google Docs. When trying to import the project to the other cell phone, the data base appears and when accepting to download the open remote shuts down.<br/>
Does anybody have experience with this kind of operations? Can anybody suggest a solution to this problem?<br/>
Thanks a lot! Hope you can help!<br/>
Best regards, Juan!</p>
