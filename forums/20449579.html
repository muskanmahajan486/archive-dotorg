				    <p>Hi</p>

<p>I'm no stranger to OpenRemote, and I have it running perfectly fine on an Ipad, 10" Motorola Xoom and iPhone.</p>

<p>However, I just bought two Tabtronics 7" Tablets to replace my Pronto's and am trying to run OpenRemote on them.</p>

<p>These tablets are 800*430 resolution. So I created a new Custom Panel with this resolution, and created some layouts.</p>

<p>However, I'm only getting about 1/4 of the layout on the screen on my tablets. When wondering if this was a resolution thing, I tried downloading my iPhone layout onto the tablet to see what would happen, and voila, it fits pretty much perfectly.</p>

<p>So in summary I have iPhone layouts at 320*480 that seem to fit perfectly on my Android 7" Tablets which are supposed to be 430*800.</p>

<p>Anyone got any ideas?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>EDIT: In fact, I just tried to measure the resolution I am actually getting on this panel and it is about 535*330 - which explains why the iPhone layout almost fits in portrait. So the question is.... is OpenRemote not capable of scaling to 800*430, or have I been duped and actually my Tabtronics tablets are not 800*430 after all, but actually 535*330 - (surely not?)</p>

<p>I had similar size adjustment issues in early Samsung tablets that were struggling with understanding screen resolutions. Partly this was due to the fact that the Android app was set to auto-scale the screen to match physical screen size (which sort of works but does create a less crisp view because of the fuzzyness the scaling causes), and partly because the older Android versions didn't deal well with larger tablet size screen resolutions (everyone was assuming more or less phone-sized screens).</p>

<p>I've not heard of Tabtronics tablets before. How old are the models you are using? Which version of Android are they running?</p>

<p>For the auto-scaling, it has been turned off in the current downloadable binaries &#8211; if you are able to compile your own binary, you could try turning it on (one line change in XML) to see if that's what the hardware expects to reach the larger screen size, especially if the tablets are a bit older variety.</p>

<p>I also have scaling issues, using a Samsung Galaxy tab 7 inch.<br/>
Does your issue affect the background image or buttons.</p>

<p>For me the background scales correctly (1024x600) but the images I use for buttons appear smaller on the tab than they do on the editor page</p>

<p>The top image shows what I get on my tablet, the bottom image shows how I have to position the buttons to get the end result on the tablet.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Graham.</p>

<p>Hmmm... possibly same problem, but different symptom. I get everything scaled incorrectly (including background). It just so happens that I also have a layout designed for an iPhone at 320*480 and this is a set of screens that appear full-screen on the iPhone. Now when I run the same layout on my 7" Tablet (which is supposed to be resolution 480*800) the iPhone layout fits just about perfectly.</p>

<p>So my problem is that my 7" tablet won't show 480*800 layouts because they're too big.... I have to create layouts much smaller (~320*480) and then they seem to be scaled up to fit the screen on the 7" tablet.</p>

<p>I didn't find the scaling code yet, so if anyone can point me at it I can have a play....</p>

<p>thx</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Martyn,</p>

<p>The screen behavior can be modified in AndroidManifest.xml where the last XML entry is:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-xml">

    &lt;supports-screens 
         android:smallScreens=<span class="code-quote">"true"</span> 
         android:normalScreens=<span class="code-quote">"true"</span> 
         android:largeScreens=<span class="code-quote">"true"</span> 
         android:xlargeScreens=<span class="code-quote">"true"</span>  
         android:anyDensity=<span class="code-quote">"false"</span> /&gt;

</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Changing the last entry on 'any density' to true will allow the Android platform to scale the bitmaps to match which ever screen size. This is not desirable for best looking graphics but it is possible that especially older devices that attempted to use Android on larger screens before they were well supported might require something like this (depending what assumptions were made by the vendor who customized Android for their device).</p>

<p>The file can be found here: <a href="https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/tags/project/Android_Console/Android_Console_2_0_0_Beta3/AndroidManifest.xml">https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/tags/project/Android_Console/Android_Console_2_0_0_Beta3/AndroidManifest.xml</a></p>

<p>The Android documentation regarding different types of screen support elements can be found here:
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html</a></p>

<p>Let us know if any of that is of help.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Nathan</p>

<p>I don't pretend to understand what's going on here, but I definitely have an Android panel running perfectly at native resolution of 1280*800. It's my Motorola Xoom. I have a custom panel set up at this resolution and it works fine.</p>

<p>My problem was (and still is) when I run a panel at the mid-range resolution of 800*430. I only get part of the layout on screen. My only option in this case is to "pretend" it's an iPhone resolution of 320*480 and then the layout fits full-screen, but the images are clearly up-scaled by something because the quality is pretty poor.</p>

<p>there was a time (a long time ago) that I couldn't get my Xoom layouts right on 1280*800, but that was fixed with a Controller update to the latest version - but that was at least 9-months ago. So I suggest you check you have the latest controller version and I can't see why 1280*800 shouldn't work - it does for me <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>, but my 7" tablet at 800*430 anguish continues <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p></font>

<p>(However its not all good news as I now have to redraw and rescale all my layouts <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>   still, you can't have it all and at lease now I have crystal clear pin sharp graphics rather than awful fuzzy up scales ones.</p>

<p>I think the background issue is different to the button size issue. I tried setting different PPI settings for the button objects but that made no difference, they would always appear the same size. I used trial and error to work out what size to make my first button (in pixels - 143x143) then went from there. </p>

<p>In the designer I had to size the orange box so that it cropped each button by about 20 - 25%, otherwise the trigger area on the remote would overlap onto the next button.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>After some messing around I figured I'd post what I found out and my solution to the problem. Button images are being shrunk approx. 25%. To be a bit more accurate, an image needs to be 1.33x the desired size. ONLY the image is being shrunk. Button area and text remain unaltered. </p>

<p>Here is my 800x1280 panel with a 100x100 checkerboard on it. The buttons on the top row are 100x100, with the image reduced to 75x75, note how the button text is in its proper place. The lower button and image are 133x133 resulting in an image of 100x100, but keeping its original button area.<br/>
<a class="confluence-thumbnail-link 800x1280" href='http://www.openremote.org/download/attachments/20449579/Screenshot_2012-09-05-14-36-55.png'><img src="attachments/thumbnails/20449579/20742187" align="absmiddle" border="0"/></a></p>

<p>Here is what the designer looks like for that panel. It's a little weird that a 100x100 button over a 100x100 section on the background shows a little bit of the right and bottom under it. I tried adjusting the relative position and ended up settling on TOP_LEFT giving the closest alignment.<br/>

<p>My solution for now is to work with images exclusively in another program, paint.net or Photoshop. I will create my layouts and button images using layers so I can move/edit/delete them as needed. Then I'll set them as backgrounds for panels and add button areas with transparent images wherever they're needed. For now this will be the easiest thing to do, and I like that I will have more control over how much of the panel I see compared to the online designer.</p>

<p>Hopefully this information will help somebody down the road. Does anyone know of a good place to find images to use for buttons?</p></font>

Re: good images for buttons - check out my global templates. I'm pretty pleased with them. If you like them you may like the button images.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Matthew,</p>

<p>The problem does seem to have gotten worse on ICS but has always been an issue. The problem is to do with display densities, OpenRemote works in pixels but Android (and most UI frameworks) work in some independent unit in the case of Android it's the DIP.</p>

<p>I am in the process of reworking the Android Console code base to fix this issue and so I can add you to the list of beta testers if you so wish.</p>

I just in the last hour rebuilt the android console (from SVN repository) with 4.2 SDK to see if that was a quick fix (low hanging fruit <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>, but a run and test on my nexus 7 found that it did not make a difference. </p></font>
