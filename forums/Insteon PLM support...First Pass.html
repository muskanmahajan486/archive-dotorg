				    <p>Since this is my first post I guess i should start with a small introduction.  I live in Texas USA and by profession am a technical jack of all trades.  I started working in QA and then moved to Performance testing, Systems Engineering and J2ee development.  I found openremote last year and was intrigued by its possibilities but living in the US the only real device options I had were X10 and Insteon.  As we all know Insteon support is not currently implemented in openremote so that left me with only X10.  Well that is about to change.  I know there is work going on to implement Insteon through ISY99 to openremote but I was not a big fan of having another integration point so I decided to research implementing Insteon via one of their serial PLMs.  After a few weeks of harvesting data I was finally ready to start writing code.  I currently have an API for basic protocol support and have a test program to talk to the modem.  It all works but is currently NOT integrated into Controller.  Over the next few weeks I (time permitting) will be cleaning up the code and getting Insteon integrated into the Controller.  This is my first open source contribution so I may have plenty of dumb questions on how source is managed and reviewed so please bear with me.  Sorry I dont have something solid to show now but if anyone has questions, comments or any other sort of remarks feel free to post them</p>

Life has been interesting the past few months...getting laid off...getting new job...getting engadged and to top it all off i had a computer failure.

<p>I'd be happy to have more Insteon work going in &#8211; let me know what type of integration you had in mind, and what type of help you'd need to get started?</p>
