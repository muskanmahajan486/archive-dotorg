				    <p>After several release candidates and extensive testing v2.0.0 of RaZberry (Z-Way) has been released.<br/>
Within the context of OpenRemote we have introduced a second channel for control. The inefficient mechanism of polling for sensor updates has been replaced by a mechanism that pushes status changes from the RaZberry to OpenRemote's UDPListener. In my own installation with some 30 devices this has resulted in a CPU load reduction of more than 50% on the z-way-server.<br/>
A large range of devices including the new Zwave+ generation are well supported now.<br/>
There is a new 5gen RaZberry plugin board available. If you order make sure to get that version. The 5gen USB stick for Windows will appear soon. Both will have user upgradeable firmware.<br/>
The configuration for the OpenRemote conections is <b><a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Z-Wave+with+Razberry">described here</a></b> and on pages linked from there.</p>
