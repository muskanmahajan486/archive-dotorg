				    <p>Hello to all,</p>

<p>Since last night i can proudly say that i have open remote running and controlling one lighting point in my knx home installation!!! (Looking forward to more complex controls) It took some effort but it was worth it!! This forum gave me a lot of guidance so i would like to give some feedback in order to help others as well.</p>

<p>My setup is as follows:</p>

<p>knx IP network device:  Eibmarkt N000401</p>

<p>open remote controller running on Windows 7</p>

<p>Antroid device Sony XPERIA ST23i phone (Android 4.0.4)</p>

<p>Network settings set to "HOME NETWORK" (i think this setting helped with some communication issues)</p>

<p>Line couplers in the knx installation programed so that they do not filter any telegrams</p>

<p>Status group adress to be different to the command group adress and to contain the status object of the device you want to control.</p>

<p>Internet provider modem-router and my wireless home router setup to have similar ip adress.</p>



<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Stavroschar</p>

In particular we are interested in the different KNX IP network interfaces people are using so we can confirm they work properly &#8211; in theory they all operate similarly given the specification and certification but in practice there are sometimes minor little differences.</p>
