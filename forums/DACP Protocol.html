<p>DACP - the audio control protocol used by Apple to control itunes.</p>

<p>It's been ported to Android/Java under GPLv3 here: <a href="http://dacp.jsharkey.org/">http://dacp.jsharkey.org/</a> so the heavy lifting has already been done, but can be used with Songbird, Foobar and others via plugins. If you have a music server/apple tv as part of your HA, this would make a great edition integrated into OR.</p>


<p>I think most of the work would have to be on the designer in adding dynamic list/search boxes and binding to the controls, and initial set-up, but all do-able I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway, thought I'd share..</p>

<p>I bought an Asus EEEBox EB1501 a few months ago, to use as iTunes server, and have spent quite some time getting Netremote control it the way I like. Got there to, say Pi/4, but Netremote always show new quirks, and with non-free software you end up begging the vendors for fixing simple bugs.

<p>For interacting with iTunes, there are also alternatives via scripting on Mac and Windows. For the UI, dynamic lists etc are not available (so the control is more restricted to play/stop/select playlist than browsing). Adding dynamic lists is quite a dedicated task.</p>

<p>Let us know if the protocol integration is something that would interest you.</p>

<p>As far as other options, I guess it would be good to know what CAN be done and how - play, stop, select playlist as Juha mentioned since that might be enough with a good sales pitch lol. Also, are there alternatives to iTunes for handling a music library that is supported by OR?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Jesse,</p>

<p>Pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Smart-Home-Othmar-Kyas-ebook/dp/B00FYUTH28/">How to Smart Home</a>. It's worth the $5 of useful information that helps you get an idea about OR for your current or future projects.</p>

<p>There's a section there about iTunes integration, for Windows (using COM scripting) and Mac OSX via the provided integration. It doesn't give the full UI browsing experience but volume control, playlists etc. are there. It's the best resource to look at so far without going into deeper estimation of implementing new functionality.</p>

<p>HTH,</p>

<p>&#8211; Juha</p></font>

<p>If you throw gifts at him, you may get Eric to tell you the system details and what he was using with the media center.</p></font>

I was using a Popcorn Hour media player that was controller via IR.</p>

<p>I guess there are ways to currently implement something close to what you want but it'll require a bit of work.</p>

<p>There is no widget to e.g. display a list of items (e.g. a list of playlist to pick one from) but you can work around that the way it's done on some receivers OSD or e.g. with AMX panels. Use a series a predefined labels representing the lines of your display. Through rules you can manipulate the values of each label to simulate some kind of list.</p>

<p>You can also put a label on top of a button in the designer, so you can simulate dynamically setting the button title this way.</p>

<p>With enough creativity, time and dialog with the customer, I'm pretty sure you can already get very close to what he wants with the current features offered by OR.</p>

<p>As I understand, this is a commercial project, so you can always ask one of the <a href="http://www.openremote.com/certified-integrators-new/">OR certified integrators</a> if they can help and provide you with a quote for the project.</p></font>
