				    <p>Hi folks, Norway calling</p>

<p>I kinda new into EIB/KNX, I have a new house (2 year) and an electrician hve install and configurated my KNX project. Now I want to program/adjust/take controll over this project, and start seaching for more info for my ideas and budget.</p>

<p>I read one article on Internet aboust HA system, and have some questions. link:<a href="http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/Reviews/Self-Build-EIB-KNX-Control-Case-Study-Review.html">http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/Reviews/Self-Build-EIB-KNX-Control-Case-Study-Review.html</a></p>

<p>In this solution it is a Gira HomeServer 2, and my budget don't alow this, so I look for a system that has some of the capabilities.</p>

<p>It is written in the article:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Simulated occupancy where the house repeats previously recorded switch pushes and blind movements when the owners are out. The actions are played back at random intervals to give a very real appearance that some one is always at home.</li>
</ul>


<p>Is this possible with this Openremote Homeserver?</p>

<p>Then I have to have som explanation about the difference of Boss and Orb. I could see in the Product group that Orb is a peace of hardware with som LinuxSW inside, but what is then the "standalone" Boss application and what can it be use to, and how do I get in contact with the Orb from my KNX/EIB/SW?</p>

<p>Has this Homeserver capabilities to make/have templates for some KNX light scenarios?</p>

<p>I lote of questions, just ask if something is formulated to difficult og wrong, not understandible. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>We expose a HTTP/REST API to trigger events on the controller. What you can do is setup a crond or other scheduler that is able to create a HTTP request and trigger such events on a schedule.</p>

<p>This is low-level and requires some technical skills. We don't have a higher level user interface for it yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what is then the "standalone" Boss application and what can it be use to</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a pure Java (cross-platform) binary that doesn't include the setup for some native Linux OS services &#8211; in this case the LIRC (for infrared) daemon that you'd need to setup separately. In case you are not focusing on IR but on KNX for example, you can use the "standalone" OR Boss software and deploy it on any system &#8211; Windows, Linux, Mac &#8211; giving you more flexibility in what hardware/OS to use as your controller.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how do I get in contact with the Orb from my KNX/EIB/SW?</p></blockquote>

<p>Connection is an IP connection on your local network. You can use any computer with the OR Boss software on it to connect, you won't necessarily need the ORB hardware to do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has this Homeserver capabilities to make/have templates for some KNX light scenarios?</p></blockquote>

<p>You can turn lights on/off on a KNX group address, and you can group multiple such commands into a macro on the controller. That gets you started with a simple scenario.  Scheduling you can do via cron or any other favorite scheduler that can generate HTTP requests.</p>
