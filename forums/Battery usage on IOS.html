				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>IOS 8 introduced a new feature to show the battery usage per application. I noticed that the openremote iOS app was #1 in this list with 1/3 of the battery over the last 24 hours (I don't have longer stats, I resinstalled openremote app yesterday).</p>

<p>Is it possible to improve the app so it doesn't eat so much battery? I don't think it's justified for what it does (in my case, app in the background most of the time).</p>

<p>Any advice to configure it accordingly is also welcome, maybe I missed something</p>

<p>Thanks<br/>
CS</p>

However, when the application is in the background, this should not happen.</p>

<p>The version of the iOS console that is currently in the AppStore really needs an update.<br/>
A lot of work has already been done towards that new version but we have not managed so far to find the time to finish and submit that version.<br/>
Until that new code base has reach a stable point and been released, we can't look into and fix these types of issues.</p></font>
