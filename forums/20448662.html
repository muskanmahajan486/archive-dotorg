				    <p>I'm a total newbie to this: for Open Remote to work with my iPhone and an iTach IP2IR, do I still need a PC that runs the controller software? If yes, does that PC need to be on the same LAN, or can it be on a WAN?</p>

I'm not sure why you would want to.  Opening up a port to the openremote controller is bad enough.  Can't imagine putting other devices in harms way.</p>

<p>Everything I have running is on the same LAN and I have one port open on my router to the openremote controller.  I could use a VPN but I'm just lazy like that.  Routing some protocols over a WAN connection can get tricky.</p>

<p>If I wanted to have the controller talk to a device that was offsite, I would setup a vpn between the two sites.</p></font>

The home is controlled via a z-wave device, but the Fujitsu uses a IR remote. The plan was to send simple ON/OFF commands to the iTach with the help of the OpenRemote iPhone Console. But there is no PC at the home, so I guess this won't work then.</p>

<p>Do you know of any software that would allow me to send IR codes to the iTach via the Web?</p></font>

I also have not tried to use openremote over a vpn either.  In theory, the right vpn should send the traffic to the device.  </p></font>

<p>Setting up a VPN is way beyond my capabilities. I think I will look at irule next - it seems to have the controller in the cloud ...</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help clearing this up!!</p></font>
