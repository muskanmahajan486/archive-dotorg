				    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I was thinking of making my own zigbee remote to control some planned projects.  For my plans this means:</p>

<p>Inexpensive and small, almost credit card sized and as thin as possible<br/>
A monochrome 128x64 LCD display<br/>
~12 buttons<br/>
USB for firmware upload<br/>
TBD: Powered by a button cell / small rechargable li-ion cell</p>


<p>I came across OpenRemote.org when doing a background search for an existing suitable products.  The ones I found either looked like they would be difficult to 're-purpose' or more expensive than is appropriate for requiring user's to also buy/already have when buying/making their own units that need control.</p>

<p>I would be very grateful if anyone knew of anything that was not a phone which sounded similar.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Richard (often looking ridiculous)</p>
