				    <p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>first of all i would like to clarify i'm an electronic with a small software background therefore pls be patient with me! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> <br/>
I just installed OpenRemote on my Qnap NAS TS 453 PRO to make some test waiting for some sensors to see how it works and decide if it's time to give a brain to my new house (which is under construction).</p>

<p>OpenRemote running smooth on the NAS, the webconsole works perfectly with the test design i made, but my problem (at the moment) is the android APK. I installed the latest 2.1.1 in both Phone (Android 4.4.2) and Tablet (Android 4.2.2) and in both device same problem: I can set up the controller, green sign but as i choose the panel, it stops at the first screen saying or "loading resourses" or "loading panel XX", and nothing happens. It seems that it is waiting for some input from the NAS......<br/>
Note that using the webconsole with crome from both devices, everything works perfectly.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions?? </p>

<p>Thanks<br/>
Costa</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Adam,</p>

<p>first of all thanks for your replay and your help to try to solve this issue.</p>

<p>As you asked, I installed OR on a windows 7 machine than, using the same design used for the NAS, i open the webconsole and it works as weel as the Android OR on my phone and on my tablet. This means my first feeling was right, the apk is probably waiting some input from the NAS which doesn't come.</p>

<p>Than....what's the next?? <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Thanks again<br/>

<p>as i wrote, OpenRemote is running on qnap nas using the pgk available in the app center which install automatically the java pkg that should be version 6.<br/>
Because of the qnap pkg, i believe the system has been tested with this version of java (the only one available as a pkg).....or someone forgot to highlight it was a must to install a differente java version?? <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> </p>

<p>If i understood, you are running openremote on a raspberry. May i ask you how many I/O ports does it manage in your system?? Is it stable?? Did you implemented the SNMP protocol??</p>

<p>Thanks<br/>
Costa  </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I have used raspberry for OR, but nowadays I'm using my nas. Although I have very different than yours: custom build with Intel CPU running Openmediavault(Debian without desktop). I don't know snap that well I could give spot on advice's for that.</p>

<p>OR works with Java 6 but at least with raspberry I got much better performance with Java 8 beta. And with oracle Java you also got better performance than openjdk. So if Java 8 is available for your qnap, I recommend to try it.</p>

<p>My home automation is based KNX and I control it through knx Ethernet router. The rest(TV, Plex, avr) of my devices are controlled via http, so I don't have experience from SNMP or Raspberry's I/O ports.</p>

<p>My raspberry was stable with high oc settings when I used it for OR.</p></font>

<p>after two nights of deep studies i found the reason why the android application doesn't starts...... i didnt set the rigt port in the "configuration controller" , "discovery" section (<a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Change+Controller+Default+Port">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Change+Controller+Default+Port</a>)</p>
