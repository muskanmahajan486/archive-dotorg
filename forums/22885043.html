				    <p>I have a time based rule (named "wake up light") that turns on the light in our bedroom every morning at 6:30.<br/>
This rule is can be turned on/off based on the status of an in memory viritual command. <br/>
This way if we for some reason dont want the light to turn on in the morning at 6:30 we can turn this rule off.</p>

<p>However, I would also like to create a rule/function that allows me to change the time for when the light should be turned on<br/>
in the moring... f ex if we would like to have the light turned on at 7 instead of 6:30...<br/>
I know this can be done by changing the rule in designer, but is there a way this can be done/controlled from the iPhone app?</p>
