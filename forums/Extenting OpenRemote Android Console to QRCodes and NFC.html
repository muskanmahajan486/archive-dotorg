				    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm currently involved a project in the MultiCom research group of the<br/>
LIG, which goal is to access home automation object's interface from a<br/>
mobile phone.<br/>
For this project, I've found OpenRemote as a promising app to start<br/>
with. My Goal is to identify physical objects with a QRCode and/or a NFC<br/>
tag, in order to access to these object's user interfaces. In this<br/>
context, each objects will have its on panel in the Boss Controller,<br/>
which will be linked by the contents of the QRCode or the NFC tag. On a<br/>
read event, the app will be able to load the right panel directly,<br/>
avoiding a few swipes of navigation.</p>

<p>If you have any comment or suggestions for this, I'll be glad.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Personally this is one of the exciting factors of working in Open Source &#8211; getting to see people take the base and extend it to some new possibilities you haven't thought of yet. And of course when they return back to the project it's even better! That's the pleasant and exciting surprise.</p>

<p>The video shows an alternative way of switching between screens in an OpenRemote Android application. Instead of the usual swipe gestures or button navigations, a screen selection can be made based on a QR code or near field communication (NFC) with the panel hardware.</p>

<p>The NFC part in particular is interesting &#8211; one could imagine a hardware touch panel that comes with a stand and if you place it on a stand in your living room or on a stand in your bedroom, it automatically switches to the current room view you're in.</p>

<p>Any other ideas how these types of features could be used in domotics? Please share here.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>It has been some time since last discussions of nfc on these forums. But lets start again.</p>

<p>As NFC is becoming increasingly popular on non-apple modern smartphones I'm thinking utilizing it more on HA. I just love how easy it is nowadays connect mobile speaker to smartphone by just touching and I think it shouldn't be any harder in home. After all, I thing all HA and smart devices should be wife-proof in use. So my scenario is following: My wife is cooking in kitchen and wants to listen internet radio or some music streaming services. I also have Denon AV-receiver and ceiling mounted speakers in kitchen connected to zone2.</p>

<p>So how I'd like things to work out is that my wife can just put the music on that she likes with her android phone and just tap (preferably hidden) NFC tag and all needed commands are send automatically. And when touched again it would disconnect. NFC tags can trigger actions on android such as connect to certain bluetooth receiver but it is also needed that AV-receiver is configured correctly play that bluetooth input to zone2. The last one is where I think of Openremote.</p>

<p>That part is already possible with Oprenremote but I'd like to Openremote run on background and do needed commands without needing to bring up the app/gui and maybe just give a notification that command has been sent. Currently I think that OR is needed to be an active application on front to use NFC tags and one also have to choose to read nfc tag from settings. </p>

<p>After all I hate when one is demoing HA, it is usually pretty GUI on Ipad or on wall-mounted screen. I think that, one should not even see the GUI in normal use and things should just magically happen as you thought.</p>

<p>So in summary: I'm hoping to get Openremote run in background and send commands without needing to open GUI. Or the other solution could be the direct url to OR command which android could go when triggered by NFC tag. Is either one doable in present or in near future?</p></font>

<p>Makes sense, and a good idea.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, definitely agree and I think will be required to move HA to mainstream in any serious way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The latter ("direct URL to OR command") is quite high on priority list at the moment, although not funded development yet at this stage which take priority over everything else (need to pay rents). Not even particularly complicated task, just requires the free time and a little bit of focus.</p>

<p>What kind of solution do you have in mind for triggering a HTTP request in response to an NFC tag? Does this already exist?</p>

<p>Also, the benefit of using URLs is that they could be platform independent and currently my smartphone is actually pure linux-based Nokia N9, but will be moving to android in the future. </p>

<p>But the reaction of phone will probably be different among different devices: For example currently some browsers show blank window when accessing direct download link and others won't show anything. Another example of this is how OR webconsole scales in wide range of different browsers even in same tablet. Keeping in mind that goal is to show just the notification of action. </p>

<p>Quick edit: The application called "Trigger" can also open urls in background..</p></font>
