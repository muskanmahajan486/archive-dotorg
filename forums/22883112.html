				    <p>Hi all</p>

<p>I run ClamAV on my NAS (which runs the OpenRemote server).</p>

<p>I also store the Android client there, and I have started getting virus alerts about :<br/>
"OpenRemote-2.0-Android_SNAPSHOT_20111012.apk", <br/>
"Android_Console_2_1_0_SNAPSHOT-2013-03-02.apk"</p>

<p>...claiming they have "Andr.Trojan.Opfake-2"</p>

<p>This may well be a false positive, but wanted to raise it just in case - as invariably it may show up on other systems as well.  I'm now running a scan on my handset (with AVG) to see if that moans, or if it's just ClamAV.   It only started doing this the other day, so it's either a false positive or an update which is now picking something up.</p>

<p>[EDIT]<br/>
The version of the app from the Google Play Store scans ok with AVG on a handset, and I don't have the above snapshots installed on an Android device, so can't check those as easily presently.</p>
