				    <p>Hi</p>

<p>Does OR has some configurable timeout settings while connecting to owfs over IP ? <br/>
I have the 1wire network with 20 x DS1820 hanging on the bus. Usually it took around 20s to read temp. from all of them  ( i.e. "for" loop in bash script, reading one by one), and around 1-2s whenever owfs has cached volatile counters. </p>

<p>However, OpenRemote is able to get temp. data from owfs only when counters are cached on owfs side. I do some sniffing over the network interface, and it looks like OR is asking for sensors one by one but not waiting for response for each one ( or waiting really short time   &lt;0.1s ). Sometime if counter is cached, then OR will get data from it but usually for uncached data OR drop/close connection.</p>

<p>From the network perspective it looks like getting:</p>

<p>1. /10.D8CD32020800/temperature (response &gt; 0.1s, drop)<br/>
2. /10.D8CD32020802/temperature (response &lt; 0.1s)<br/>
20.23<br/>
3. /10.D8CD32020803/temperature (response &gt; 0.1s, drop)<br/>
<span class="error">&#91;..&#93;</span></p>

<p>where only on step 2 got cached data. OR asking for all of 20 sensors is usually spending less than 2s on whole operation ( while sending/receiving data from owfs), while it's quite impossible to read all data in time less than 20-25s (if reading uncached)</p>

<p>Actually I have no clue how to solve this issue, beside setting the cache to the large value and running  script from cron every 3 minutes only to refresh owfs cache. Would it be possible to enlarge time reserved for response from owfs for each sensor ? </p>

<p>Thanks for your help,<br/>
Maciej.</p>
