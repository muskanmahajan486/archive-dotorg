				    <p>Heya Folks, <br/>
    Is it just me or has designer been down for two days?  All I see is:</p>

<p>OpenRemote Professional Designer</p>

<p>We are currently performing maintenance work on the server, we'll be back online soon.</p>

<p>Does anyone post maintenance windows?  If there is an outage do they post it anywhere?  I am newer to OR and use to projects with more communications.</p>

<p>Thanks, <br/>
JG</p>

<p>Yes, we do send an e-mail blast to all Pro users where there is a planned maintenance.</p>

<p>We've been experiencing quite a few unexpected down times lately and I'm actively looking into fixing that ASAP.</p></font>

<p>UPDATE the designer is back again but now my panel screens do not show up. They appear if I highlight the screen, go to the command tab, and go back to the screen tab. Then that screen shows up. To switch to a different screen you have to, again,  highlight the screen, go to commands, and go back. </p>

<p>MORE IMPORTANTLY the ability to select multiple items on a screen is gone. Right Click and Shift Click no longer seem to work.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: Since I saw no other complaints I assumed it had to be my system. I dumped IE11 and used chrome and things are working. So it must be me. If others have an issue it may be IE11 at fault.</p></font>

<p>Feature Request:<br/>
It would be nice to have some way to access previous versions of the designer. This is the third time in 2 months that I have tried to get some work done and the designer is down. I only get a few hours of opportunity to work on the designer (because of travel and my job). When the designer goes down it means a lost opportunity until my next bit of free time. Being able to access the previous working version would help. You guys are doing a great job. Timing on the site outage has just not been in my favor.</p></font>
