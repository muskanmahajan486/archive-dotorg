				    <p>Hi, </p>

<p>For this topic, I found a great article about green office. </p>

<p>10 Steps You Can Take to Make Your Business More Eco-Friendly </p>


<p>"Becoming more eco-friendly, or going green, will benefit both the environment and your business. For one, it cuts down on costs. By saving money in certain areas, you can spend more in other areas, such as marketing to grow your business, or just take more of a profit." </p>

<p>There are many different ways in which companies can be more eco-friendly. Here are 10 super-easy ways to start making a difference in the environment now: </p>

<p>Change your lighting </p>

<p>Switch to energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs instead of using traditional incandescent bulbs. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, they use 75% less energy. Remember, little changes do add up, and you have to start somewhere. </p>

<p>Cut down on heating and cooling </p>

<p>Stop wasting energy (and money) on heating and cooling by learning to be less wasteful and more energy-efficient. Set the thermometer higher or lower depending on business and non-business hours, and don't spend money on heating or cooling unused rooms. </p>


<p>For more, you can go to this page, i think it is worth to read <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>
