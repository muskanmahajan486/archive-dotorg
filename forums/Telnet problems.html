				    <p>When I operate my light switch on OR it sends "null|on" (or off) which is received by the wifi light switch and operates the light. The wifi switch then returns "on" or "off" to OR but OR does not receive it. I can see the reply using wireshark but it doesn't appear in the telnet logs or debug.<br/>
When a sensor command is sent the same line of code in the wifi switch sends the same reply("on" or "off") and it is received without any problems.<br/>
I can workaround it by polling the switch state every second but I don't think that is not satisfactory.</p>
