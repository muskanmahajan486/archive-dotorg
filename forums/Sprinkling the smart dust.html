				    <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I'm just getting my feet and appetite w(h)et with this thing called OpenRemote. That's to say i'm a total noob, looking for a home automation infrastructure that doesn't suck (much). So far my greatest feat has been to control my garden lights and car engine heater with a relay box connected to a Nanode (a glorified Arduino-with-an-Ethernet) running a hacked-together httpd interface, controlled by cron &amp; curl from another Linux box. To turn on the Christmas lights manually, i need to say something like http://&lt;nanode&gt;/1/HIGH. Not very elegant.</p>

<p>OpenRemote looks interesting but there's something i haven't grokked yet. How do you add the smartness to your house with OpenRemote? Or do you do so at all? I understand that you can get input from a Z-Wave door sensor (nifty videos, btw) to a remote control but how can i directly wire the door sensor input to the light? How do i turn on the lights when it's dark and shut them off again when it's bedtime? Without using the user interface? Can i use OpenRemote Controller for that? Should i? Or need i use some totally different piece of server software to route events, states and whatnots between my sensors and actuators?</p>

<p>It's cold and wet. Must be Finland in December.<br/>

Here you can define rules that map together sensors and actuators, have time based events and do all the things you are looking for <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
Besides that you can define your own UI which can be dsiplayed on iOS, Androind and web.<br/>
Everything is managed by the OpenRemote controller which is the only box you need and if you use a NAS to run the controller, you don't even need an extra box.</p></font>

<p>Will it include some kind of rudimentary calculation features too? Here's my dream scenario:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>It is a working day. The car is scheduled for a 07:30 departure</li>
	<li>At 06:00 we check the outside temperature</li>
	<li>Do some mathemagic to interpolate when the engine heater should start, depending on said temperature</li>
</ul>


<p>That was geeky <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I suppose a similar scenario is: In the evening, if the moisture sensor says the lawn is dry and Google (or yr.no) thinks it won't rain tonight, water the lawn for thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Is there anything preliminary about Drools already published?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>It depends.</p>

<p>For function definitions (calculations, etc.) Java syntax is required with rules. Simple actions based on events can be handled with decision tables. The first iterations you will see will default to the Java-like rule language syntax (the rules are compiled into Java). In most common cases the rule consequences (the Java syntax) are one-liners.</p>

<p>The service provider interface where rules are plugged in can be used to introduce imperative scripting languages instead of rules. None are provided yet since rules do cover most of the common use cases. If you want to contribute one, you'll need to re-learn Java in order to provide the script language integration to the controller. There's no documentation yet how to do this so you will also need to be able to read the Java code to figure out how to do it.</p>

Does this mean that Drools Expert User Guide, and more in particular Chapter 5: The rule language (<a href="http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.3.0.Final/drools-expert-docs/html/ch05.html">http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.3.0.Final/drools-expert-docs/html/ch05.html</a>) is the reference to use for the rules in modeler? Or has openremote a slimmed down implementation? I have seen the examples you've given in an other thread. They are helpful, but I prefer a syntax to get an idea of the potential of the rules engine. Sorry for asking so many trivial questions lately </p></font>
