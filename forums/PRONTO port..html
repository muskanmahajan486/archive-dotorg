				    <p>There seems to be quite a bit of interest in porting the Pronto technologies here.  This thread is meant to aggregate people that are interested and defining what could be interesting. </p>

<p>For example, maybe a XCF translator to our XML format? It could be fairly straightforward.  </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I've just managed to open and close relay ports of the RFX9600 from my laptop by analyzing the frames.<br/>
What I've figured out so far:</p>

<p>RFX udp port: 65442<br/>
Hex:</p>

<p>open relay 1: 0000000000000000000000006300000600000000<br/>
close relay 1: 0000010000000000000000006300000600010000<br/>
open relay 2: 0000020000000000000000006300000601000000<br/>
close relay 2: 0000030000000000000000006300000601010000<br/>
toggle relay 1: 0000040000000000000000006400000500000000<br/>
toggle relay 2: 0000050000000000000000006400000501000000<br/>
query relay 1: 0000060000000000000000006500000500000000<br/>
query relay 2: 0000070000000000000000006500000501000000</p>

<p>response open relay 1: 00000640020000000000000500000000<br/>
response close relay 1: 00000740020000000000000501000000</p>

<p>There is a lot more communication going on (<a href="http://www.remotecentral.com/cgi-bin/forums/viewpost.cgi?1036095" title="sample relay flow I've posted on remote central">sample relay flow</a>), I think the remote asks the RFX if it's ready and the RFX tells the remote if it succeded and things like that. But just sending the commands works.</p>

<p>First part (000000) of the send command seems to be a number to indicate the sequence. 63 is open/close relay (64=toggle relay, 65=query relay, 40=IR, 50=RS232), the 00 (01, 02, 03) after that is the relay's port number, the 00 after that is open or close (01).<br/>
The response contains the sequence number (000006,000007) of the send item. Which makes sense because it uses UDP.<br/>
The bytes after the id (40) seem to be a reponse type or something like that(40=relaystate???), the bytes after that (02) are also a sequental number, some where around 01 is the relay's state (00 = open, 01 is closed)</p>

<p>Seems as if I've got some more work to do...</p></font>

<p>Makes sense that it checks if the port is available, I see this occuring in the panel.</p>

<p>I assume the sense relays there would be a check and return...</p>

<p>Beintersting to see what happens on the serial side and IR.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

It's possible to send multiple data + end data (multiple commands) in one packet.</p>

<p>IR is something I look at later, I need a learned command (not one from the database) because I can see what's send (you can only peek at learned codes).</p>

<p>It's a shame that I've got so much work to do. I've got a few projects I need to finish first.<br/>
Reading openremotes xml and dynamicly building the pronto gui from prontoscript is a job I'm looking to forward too aswell. But I can't do my daytime job, figure out the complete RFX protocol, get openremote to work with that protocol, build an openremote Pronto module (for the TSU) and do some other projects while keeping my child and wife happy. So come on guys, who's going to help?</p></font>

<p>cool and has the name'Pronto' in it"... Ok, let's be constructive.</p>

<p>There are (at least?) three different generations of Prontos around. See <a href="http://www.pronto.philips.com/Products/Archive/">http://www.pronto.philips.com/Products/Archive/</a> on the first and second. The first</p>

<p>generation ises ccf configuration files. This is a binary format, but has been reverse</p>

<p>engineered. There exists a very nice open-source Java project <a href="http://www.giantlaser.com/tonto/">Tonto</a>, normally described as</p>

<p>a replacement for Prontoedit, but alsp containing a Java library for manipulating CCF files.</p>

<p>Using this library, it is possible to extract anything from a CCF file. For example, I have done</p>

<p>this, see <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Introducing+myself+and+my+project%2C+Harc?focusedCommentId=12847135&amp;#comment-12847135">here</a>. It can also be mentioned that <a href="http://www.promixis.com/">Promixis</a>' Netremote uses a slightly extended</p>

<p>version of the CCF format.The second generation uses configuration files with the exension .pcf.<br/>
This is nothing but a zip-file, consisting of a&nbsp; number of bmp bitmaps,<br/>
and an XML file (ConfigEdit.xml). Here is a sample of the xml:</p>
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">

<p>I have never had my hands on a current Pronto, using configuration files with the ending</p>

<p>of xcf. I strongly suspect they are similar, at least in spirit (AV Dorks' comment above</p>

<p>supports this.) Prontoscript is nothing but possibly extended Javascript (ECMAScript).</p>

<p>With a tool like, say, XSLT it should not be too hard to extract desired information.</p>

<p>Probably a 90%-translator to the controller XML format can be made within a few days.</p>

<p>Since there are certainly minor details around, getting the last 10% right is probably not</p>

<p>worth it. But I also doubt the general usefulness: there are simply too many differences</p>

<p>between OR Designer and Pronto &#45;&#45; and the <em>different</em> Prontos. Sort-of like aliasing Unix'</p>

<p>ls to dir for the MSDOS user... Still, extracting things like IR-commands may of course be</p>

<p>sensible.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The Pronto's I was talking about are the latest generation. So the TSU9300, 9400, 9600 and 9800 with the extenders RFX9400 and RFX9600.</p>

<p>Running ProntoScript should be very easy. It's just javascript with some extra objects. Al we would need to do is create those extra objects (like Activity, CF, Diagnostics, etc) and be able to execute javascript.</p>

<p>So by doing four things (Build a RFX protocol, build an openremote Pronto module, build an import XCF function, build support for ProntoScript) there could be many thing possible:</p>

<p>1) Use the TSU9400, 9600 and 9800 (even the 9300 with a custom older firmware that enables ProntoScript) as a openremote client.<br/>
2) Use the RFX9400 and 9600 as a microcontroller based translation unit.<br/>
3) Use Pronto configuration files (there are really many)<br/>
4) Use Pronto modules (there are a lot)</p>

<p>And you can't compare the last gen Pronto's to earlier models. They are very different. They also are a lot nicer. The 9600 and 9800 feature VGA screens. They also have hardbuttons, which would be a + on tablets. At the downside they lack CPU power (200Mhz Risc) and have no graphics acceleration or browser. But as a remote they are great.</p>

<p>The RFX devices are quite nice as microcontroller based translation unit (RFX9600 has 4 RS232 ports, 4 IR, 4 relays), the only downside is that they can only do one thing at a time, but that would be an easy fix by buffering from the controller or openremote client.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>IMHO, I cannot say I agree that efforts aimed at a pronto import for any pronto version would not be valuable. As a programmer, I understand the argument that going that last 10 percent is not a worthwhile endeavour since many people venturing into the OR releam are likely to have experience of some sort in programming.</p>

<p>As an end user of all three versions of the Pronto designers, they seem to me to be significantly more featureful than the current OR designer. If there were an import function, those in the pronto community could still use existing software to quickly design front-end UIs for OR.</p>


<p>Also as an end user of software in general, I find it extremely frustrating to use an import function that does not do a good job of translation. I can see people familiar with the prontos, like myself, wanting to use OR, but being put off because of the current UI designer. Whether that begs improvement in the OR designer, or a proto port that does a great job is something that I do not feel qualified to answer. I do know that if there were an import that would take my PCF from the previous version of pronto (TSU-7500) and import it with a high degree of accuracy, I would be less reluctant to join the OR realm. That is me, however, and at this time, I do not have a lot of spare time to invest in learning a completely different system.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I'm actually an happy user of a pronto 9600 remote and I would like to contribute my experience to the discussion.<br/>
The pronto PEP actually seems to me more featered than the OR UI designer. With pronto-script abilities and event-driven function calls it's actually possible to design 2-way interactive pages for controlling things like mediaservers, musicservers, ip-cams, etc...There are for example free and commercial pronto modules for controlling slimserver, xbmc, sonos and such.<br/>
Even if I don't actually use interactive pages, but have just designed few control panels for one-way control of my home-theater, I'm actually in the process of starting the design/integration of pages for controlling my slimserver, apple tv, my indigo home automation server for lights, irrigation and hvac.<br/>
Problem is: I also own an iphone, an ipod touch and I will soon buy an ipad. I would like to be able to have full control not only with the pronto but also with my other devices. And ... why not ... on the web too. And here comes the problem: why investing a lot of effort in designing/integrating pronto pages when I will need to redesign all of them using other tools for iphone/ipad/web ?<br/>
To make a long story short: I see a great value proposition in building a conversion tool which will get a pronto xcf file in input beeing able to deploy it on the web, on iphone, ipad, android and future other platforms.<br/>
Untill PEP will be a better UI design tool than OR UI designer, integrators and DIYers could still design the interface on PEP, deply it using PEP on the Pronto and OR on all other platforms.<br/>
Just my 2cents. </p></font>

If you don't have a switch that can duplicate the port of the extender, the best way to analyse is:</p>

<p>Add your extender to your project with the ip of your computer.</p>

<p>1.	Get <a href="http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/sudppipe.zip">http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/sudppipe.zip</a><br/>
2.	sudppipe -x -a c:\test.cap extenderip 65442 65442</p>

<p>This will output all frames from TSU and from extender on screen (-x) and to a .cap file (-a c:\test.cap) that you can open with WireShark.<br/>
You can even program a dll to parse the data and load it (by adding a -l parameter). This last option excites me, easy way to test if the understanding of the protocol is correct.</p></font>

<p>I should have this up over the weekend and I will post a wireshark file.</p>

<p>Plenty of "learned" ir....</p>


<p>I have a powersense device.</p>

<p>The 232 device may be ok...&nbsp; It is a snap av 4x4 video matrix.&nbsp; The command are asc and 2 digit, looking for a hex device. some use different start end commands ie pana pro \x02DWA:OVL1\x03 vs the prior just 11.&nbsp; Not sure what they do with the start/ends but i have seen many different start stops, not corresponding to the manufacturers specs.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; a russound vm1 that uses hex.&nbsp; So I think I may have this covered.&nbsp; The only bit I will not have is the 2 way.&nbsp; But I can access a russound cam at some point in the near future with this.</p></font>
