				    <p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>I looked into this system a number of months ago but I am now ready with finalized goals for how I want this first project to go. However, I am still not sure of the best way to implement my automation.. I don't want to go out and buy things I don't need or buy the wrong hardware and set myself back from the start, so I figured I would throw my situation out to the masters here on this forum! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>The set up should be pretty simple.. Everything is in one room, and I only have a few devices I want to connect right now (this is my "trial" so to speak, before I enter into any larger-scale projects).</p>

<p>Devices:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Computer</li>
	<li>Television:</li>
</ul>


				    
                                            <div class="tabletitle">
                            <a name="comments">Comments:</a>
                        </div>

                        <table border="0" width="100%">
                                                        <tr>
                                <td >
                                    <a name="comment-17956964"></a>
                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Woah, didn't mean to post yet! haha was trying to save it as a draft.. oh well, where I left off:</p>

<p>Devices:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Desktop computer</li>
	<li>Television</li>
	<li>Stereo</li>
</ul>


<p>Pannel:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>iPhone 4</li>
</ul>


<p>Tasks:<br/>
Switch stereo inputs/volume<br/>
Control television inputs/channels</p>

<p>Those are the main things I want to be able to control in this room. (May be adding a device or two in the future, such as a gaming console, but that shouldn't be difficult if I can get these to work together).</p>

<p>As I understand it, I use my computer as the main communication between the devices and need to buy and IR-to-IP bridge. I've been looking into this, and was recommended IRTrans and GlobalCache as two options. Would one of these be better to go with under these circumstances? It seems to me that IRTrans would be more difficult because it broadcasts the IR signal instead of sending it through a cord (which would be difficult to make sure everything can "see" it, I would think). Does GlobalCache allow me to talk from my iPhone to my computer and then to the bridge itself?</p>

<p>Also, one problem I foresee is the lack of Ethernet connections. This area only has one (which my computer is plugged into).. I suppose I could buy a small switch to allow more inputs for the room. But more importantly, the ethernet network and the wireless networks are separate, so how would my iPhone on the wireless network be able to communicate with the computer/stack on the ethernet network? I do also have wireless on my computer, so could the iPhone talk to the computer over wireless and then the computer talk to the stack over ethernet? I did see that IRTrans has a wifi option that would potentially solve this problem but it is much much more expensive than GlobalCache.</p>

<p>Finally, would I need to do any coding to complete this project? I have programmed in Java, Objective-C, and a bit here and there in other languages before, so I can if need be, but would like to know what I'm getting myself into haha. Also, do I need an Apple Developer's license to install the panel interfaces on my iPhone?</p>

<p>I hope some of this makes sense and can illustrate my situation/issues. If you can provide any assistance, I would greatly appreciate it! And if you need any more information, let me know, I'll try to explain more! Sorry if this does get confusing, kind of rushed right now and not at home this weekend, but I wanted to get this out there so I can get going on the project! Thanks again! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>You won't need Apple Developer license to install the released panel rendered on your iPhone. If you plan on doing development, then having a dev account probably makes sense.</p>

<p>The networking questions really depend how you want to set things up. There are multiple ways to go about it. Networks can be bridged, you can add a switch or a router, etc.</p>
