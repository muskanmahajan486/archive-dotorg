				    <p>Who has the largest setup? <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>So far, I've managed to get OR working with :</p>

<p>LightwaveRF (using UDP) - controlling some lights via a power socket, and my central heating (relay)<br/>
Philips Hue (using HTTP/JSON) - 5 lights, after some kind help from forum contributors<br/>
LG TV (using Globalcache IP2IR - it's not a smart TV) - via IR<br/>
Mertik Maxitrol Fire - (using Globalcache IP2IR) - via IR (bit hit &amp; miss but mostly works)<br/>
Onkyo NR609 A/V receiver (using TCP)<br/>
PS3 Slim (using TCP to the A/V receiver, via HDMI)<br/>
UK VirginMedia TiVo (using Telnet)</p>

<p>I've tried to get Internet Radio/MP3 playback working on the A/V controlled by OR, but have posted about the issues with 2 way data (the A/V floods OR with DLNA info) - but I'm still trying various methods <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Happy to share/receive hints/tips on any of the above devices!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asciitohex.com/">http://www.asciitohex.com/</a> has been a really helpful website <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
Also, Hercules ( <a href="http://www.hw-group.com/products/hercules/index_en.html#download">http://www.hw-group.com/products/hercules/index_en.html#download</a> ) has been REALLY helpful in testing codes prior to embedding in OR.<br/>
GlobalCache also provide a utility to convert HEX to IR, and it reads Philips Pronto codes, which I used to use - so that has saved time!</p>

<p>That's a nice set up and thank you for sharing. Would be really interested in further write-up, if you're motivated to do so. Something on the wiki, or perhaps an article in the newsletter? Videos would be nice too, or anything else you can think of.</p>

<p>Let us know if you're interested.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>&#8211; Juha</p>

<p>PS. I think there might be a competition coming up too on the coolest user story with OpenRemote, so that might also motivate you to polish things up....</p>

<p>Some of my other articles are here : <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/techbobbins/home/articles">https://sites.google.com/site/techbobbins/home/articles</a> (OpenRemote is running on my OpenMediaVault box - and OR gets a brief mention in my PS3/HDMI article at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/techbobbins/home/articles/control-your-ps3">https://sites.google.com/site/techbobbins/home/articles/control-your-ps3</a> )</p>

<p>My main issue is just time to make nice graphics, so the ones I used on my Pronto before (some of which I grabbed from the web) are in use, but the new things (like the fire controls) are just stock buttons for now.</p>

<p>(but, I've still come a long way since my HomeEasy lights/heating, which was only controlled via my remote and/or SMS!)</p>

If I put something together do you want it emailing, or on my site and send you a link? Or...? <br/>

<p>From my perspective I like it when content is hosted on this site, as it makes it clearer for the users when they don't bounce around multiple sites, and allows everyone to participate with edits and comments. So you could do what Pieter suggested and experiment creating wiki pages on your personal space and once you have something ready to share, it is trivial to move to the public site. (There are a few things this requires from your side, you'll need to get familiar with the wiki markup).</p>

<p>There's a <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/website/Wiki+Markup+Quick+Start" title="Wiki Markup Quick Start">Wiki Markup Quick Start</a> for the basics, you can create a personal space from one of the tabs in your user profile page. For the rest, you can email me questions: juha at openremote dot org</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Markus</p>

<p>It depends what series of Onkyo you have.<br/>
My first Onkyo was a TX-SR608.  My current is a TX-NR609.  The "key" bit is the S or the N - as the "N" is network enabled <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>If you have a non-N series, you will need something like an iTach and some time to clone your remote IR signals, or (something I have not done) look into RIHD (remote interactive over HDMI) - which is (I suspect) the reverse of what I'm about to say <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>If however you have an "N" series amp, your life is MUCH easier (and Google is your friend) <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Basically, Onkyo provide an Android/iPhone app to run your A/V receiver.  You do however need to enable "Network Remote" support in your setup menus - and the default port is 60128.</p>

<p>Someone ran Wireshark to trap the protocol, but they are the same between amps - with new features being added.  It's based (I believe) on the Integra ISCP (Integra Serial Control Protocol) and just works on Onkyo.  The main list of IR and TCP codes are posted here :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.awe-europe.com/ir_232.html">http://www.awe-europe.com/ir_232.html</a> - as this has both IR and IP codes listed you could program up an iTach if you convert the IR to Hex and fire it over TCP to your iTach instead of the Amp, which I describe below <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Anyway, to cut a long story short, each command has a prefix (in HEX), and then an instruction.<br/>
The "prefix" for all HEX commands is 43 44 56 50 57 52 4f 4e  and the suffix is always 0D</p>

<p>So, if you want to drive a PS3 hooked up to your BD/DVD input, you will need to use the Onkyo CDV command set listed in the IP command Excel sheet from the above link.</p>

<p>To power it on, you'd need to add "PWRON" - so you have "CDVPWRON".  Except you need that in HEX.<br/>
So, use the Ascii to Hex website to convert CDV commands such as CDVPWRON to become 43 44 56 50 57 52 4f 4e</p>

<p>Remove the spaces and capitalise (4344565057524F4E)</p>

<p>Combine the prefix, command string and suffix 0x495343500000001000000009010000002131 + 4344565057524F4E + 0D so you get</p>

<p>0x4953435000000010000000090100000021314344565057524F4E0D</p>

<p>The 0x is added by me as OpenRemote needs it.<br/>
Then create a TCP command pointing to your Onkyo IP (set it up on static!) and port, and click.  Make a PWRON and PWROFF button to test/annoy your PS3 <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I wrote this up at my blog originally via <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/techbobbins/home/articles/control-your-ps3">https://sites.google.com/site/techbobbins/home/articles/control-your-ps3</a></p>

<p>For me, the ultimate win has been driving the PS3 from the Onkyo, so I can remove my PS3 Toothfairy IR2BT interface, and save some power.  I was clued into this by someone pointing out that you could drive the PS3 from the Onkyo remote, and given I'd upgraded to an N series, thought "Righto, time to get upgrading" <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I've asked Pierre &amp; Juha if they want me to create a "bulk" command set to shove in the beehive, but haven't had a yes/no yet <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> - at present my minimum implementation can power on/off the amp and PS3, change to specific inputs, turn the volume up/down/mute - and run the PS3.</p>

<p>SERIOUS NOTE : I have posted on this before - the Onkyo CAN overwhelm OpenRemote if you switch to NET/Internet Radio or DLNA modes.  The TCP interface sends back all the directory info, or MP3 info, and this can be "a lot".  I recommended a "send only" option for TCP, so you can send the command and ignore the response (as it should be on screen) - although in future it would be nice to put info on the OpenRemote display panel too - but right now it seems to REALLY clog it up :\</p>

<p>Normal TV/DVD/CD etc operation however is fine - although I do sometimes get an issue with HDMI (PS3) control which causes OR or the amp to keep connections open - but I have a manual (button pressing on the A/V amp) method to reset that if it happens to you.</p>

<p>Happy hacking <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>
