				    <p>I have used OpenRemote happily for everything in our home (lights, thermostat, TV, Music, etc) since 2013, and this is my first post and my first unsolvable issue.  I apologize if this is posted in the wrong place or if this information is available elsewhere, but I haven't been able to find any documentation on this change so far.</p>

<p>On my iPhone 5S, the OpenRemote iOS App automatically updated from 2.1.3 to 2.2.0 overnight (4/20/16), and I'm having myriad issues.  Here is the iOS app page - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openremote/id407587441?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openremote/id407587441?mt=8</a>.</p>

<p>1) When I try to open the updated iOS app, there is a popup message which says "ERROR OCCUR - Generic HTTP Error".  When I click OK the app displays a black screen.  I've been using the default "iPhone" panel with standard settings since the beginning, my controller is version 2.2.0. </p>

<p>2) Everything is working properly on my other iOS devices, running the older version of the iOS app.</p>

<p>3) I created a new standard "iPhone" panel in designer and copied all the groups/screens onto it, and when I choose this panel in the iOS app, I do not get an error message, and the app loads some (but not all) images.  Navigation works, although the Tab Bar is now white, so the tab bar nav icons are hard to read.  No buttons, sliders, indicators, etc work at all.  The buttons do animate presses on the screen, so the app is not frozen.  It is as if some of the images have loaded, but there is a disconnect from the controller and then no further communication.  The controller does not show any errors on the console.</p>

<p>4) I created a new Custom Panel with iPhone 5S screen dimensions 640x1136, and I added 1 background image and 1 button to see if this simple configuration would work, but it behaves the same way.  The panel loads, the button animates, but the controller never receives the commands.</p>

<p>At this point, I am out of quick ideas to try; and we have come to rely on OR on a daily (really hourly) basis for everything in our home, so I am motivated to solve this issue ASAP.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed reading many great ideas and I've regularly found fantastic support resources on this forum; if someone could point me in the right direction I would be very grateful!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Update: I was able to get the default panel to load and regain some functionality in the iOS app version 2.2.0 by disabling the security features in the controller.  I basically just re-commented out the security sections in web.xml, which I had previously configured following the instructions here: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/controller2.0.1+user+name+password+set+up">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/controller2.0.1+user+name+password+set+up</a></p>

<p>Now the default iphone panel loads in iOS app version 2.2.0, and most of the indicators are receiving the current states of switches/dimmers, etc from the controller; however, I still have 4 critical issues:</p>

<p>1) One of my screens loads no images, controls, or indicators (including the background image).  This screen only loads a black screen with text labels and one default slider image, which is non-functional, and the nav bar.  No background, button, switch, or slider images load on that page, and I cannot determine why.  The other 9 screens load properly.</p>

<p>2) Throughout the panel, all sliders are non-functional.  They move when you slide them; however, they do not send commands to the controller.  They do update to indicate the current status when the sliders are adjusted from other devices running the older iOS app.  Buttons and switches seem to work fine.</p>

<p>3) Version 2.2.0 loads in less than a second (a bit faster than version 2.1.3), but it loads without the nav bar, which is unusable.  Every time I open the app I have to go into settings and then click "Done" to re-load the nav bar, and often I have to do it twice.  This is very annoying and will confuse my wife and kids, and our babysitter.</p>

<p>4) Security is important to me, and I'd like to re-enable security as soon as possible.  So far as I can tell, enabling security prevents communication with the controller in iOS app version 2.2.0.</p>

<p>Any ideas on these issues?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></font>

<p>Govinda, do you have the openremote app version 2.1.3 *.ipa file from your iTunes phone backup by any chance?</p>
