				    <p>Well, I know OpenRemote is a server-client engine that lets us control things from Android/Ipad remotes. I also know that OpenRemote controller can communicate with different I/O technologies via plugins, but nothing else. I've tried to find some other informations without success so here I am with my questions <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>About OpenRemote controller:</p>

<p>1. How is OpenRemote configured? I've not seen any mention about web config interfaces or something similar.</p>

<p>2. Is OpenRemote controller comparable to other Home Automation servers like HomeSeer, Hal or Mr. House or is it just a server for remotes and a gateway for external devices?</p>

<p>2.1. Does OpenRemote controller provide a web interface for monitoring and controlling devices without having to use remotes?<br/>
2.2. Does OR controller let you program events?<br/>
2.3. Any additional feature like graphs or scripting engine?</p>

<p>About OpenRemote remotes:</p>

<p>3. Are graphical resources initially stored in remotes or are they downloaded from the controller?</p>

<p>4. Is there any document or link where communications between remotes and controller are explained?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Daniel.</p>

<p>1. There is a online designer where you create your design. The design includes a graphical UI for a remote and configuration of your devices. It maps the controls of the UI to commands of your devices. The design is uploaded to the controller. After the design is uploaded devices connected to the controller can be used as remotes using your ui design. </p>

<p>2. There is protocols implemented for a number of devices, including HA systems (Russound, Lutron). New protocols is added constantly. The ones you mention are not supported, to-date. </p>

<p>2.1. Yes. There is the 'console' project where you can use any browser for device. <br/>
2.2., 2.3. There is so far practically no support for programming or scripting in the designs created using the tooling. </p>

<p>3. They are downloaded from the controller. </p>

<p>4. Well. You should really start with looking what is there. Make sure to make notes on what may be improved so that when you know your way around you can either suggest improvements or, if you apply for an editor account, you may update the documentation yourself. </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks Torbj√∂rn. I now have a better idea about the big picture I think.</p>

<p>Your explanation and some other readings have helped me understand a bit more about the nature of OpenRemote. It seams clear to me that OpenRemote primarily focus on providing GUI interfaces for multiple Home Automation technologies so comparing OR with HomeSeer, HAL or Mr. House is a no sense IMO. I'd even say that OR is perfectly complementary to that kind of software.</p>

<p>Since most of my hardware is controllable via IP, I find the available TCP and HTTP remote protocols very interesting and simple to use. On the other hand, having the possibility to send such TCP and HTTP requests directly from the remote to the end device would have been even greater. I've read that this is currently possible but only for KNX gateways.</p>

<p>Regards.</p></font>
