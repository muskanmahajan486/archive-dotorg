				    <p>Hello everyone.</p>

<p>I'm new to OpenRemote which I recently found browsing the web looking for a smart home automation system independent from the hardware devices I already have. I think OpenRemote has powerful features and is just what I was looking for!</p>

<p>I know OpenRemote works with the Drools engine in order to create rules which add intelligence to the automation system. As I'm not a developer (I'm only a big enthusiast of these topics!) it's difficult for me to write rules with the right syntax of the 'Drools Expert' flavour, as it is mentioned by JUHA LINDFORS in this post: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Sprinkling+the+smart+dust?focusedCommentId=19434028#comment-19434028">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Sprinkling+the+smart+dust?focusedCommentId=19434028#comment-19434028</a></p>

<p>So, I've tried to use 'Drools Guvnor' (<a href="http://www.jboss.org/drools/drools-guvnor.html">http://www.jboss.org/drools/drools-guvnor.html</a>) which provides a visual interface to define rules (decision tables, etc.). The problem I have is to configure drools so it can access the 'Fact Model' OpenRemote uses (in order to make sensors, commands, etc. available in Guvnor interface).</p>

<p>I've followed each of the methods the Drool Guvnor documentation explains (<a href="http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.4.0.Final/drools-guvnor-docs/html_single/index.html#d0e1589">http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.4.0.Final/drools-guvnor-docs/html_single/index.html#d0e1589</a>) with no success. I don't know where the jar files of OpenRemote which define the Fact Model are stored or how to link the 'two worlds' (OpenRemote + Drools Guvnor).</p>

<p>Of course, both the OpenRemote Controller and the Drools Guvnor are installed and running OK in my Linux system. I'm also using mochad to control the CM15-usb hardware I have (X10 protocol).</p>

<p>I would appreciate a bit of help in this issue from this great community.</p>

<p>Thank you very much,</p>

<p>Roberto Serrano</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Rick,</p>

<p>The Zipato solution looks really nice.  The visual gui to define rules seems to be intuitive and powerfull. The problem I see is that it is a close solution , just the opposite to OpenRemote. And this is the reason why I try to find the way to get a visual GUI to define rules (in this case drools guvnor) to complete this fantastic home automation system.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link, it is very interesting! </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I totally agree with you on the close vv. open aspects and the unleashed powers that exist in and the benefits that come from the open source movement.<br/>
That's why I like OR so much too. Having that said, service providers might build commercial versions on OpenRemote with sexy GUI's like Zipato to differentiate themselves. Which is a good thing since they will leverage open source to reduce their own cost (and hopefully price). As long as they also contribute back of course <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
Looking at the architecture of Zipato in a glance, its concept looks similar to OpenRemote (devices and design in the cloud/host, sync with controller, etc)<br/>
Zipato said the solution was build with telco background, and besides the well thought of GUI for end-users, they also have a configurable service-module on top that allows for granular (subscription)fee structures on a per device and per rule(set) basis. Similar as telco's do with their payment-plans. So far they are (although closed) the most advanced I've seen using this architecture. <br/>
Anyway, that a decent rules-GUI will be needed for OpenRemote, to really take of, seems eminent to me. </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I think the same. The power of OpenRemote lays on its open architecture, which may be easily customized by companies offering their own solutions but a lower price for the final customer. And, of course, these companies should also give a feedback to the community in order to support the project.</p>

<p>I think, it's a matter of time that OR includes some kind of visual GUI to define rules. OR shows its full potential when focusing in the 'smart' side of the home automation systems. For me, it wouldn't be any significant difference between a simple timer which switch on and off the lights in a regular basis and an OR-based system without rules. For a final customer, it may be too 'hard' to set up a dedicated server just to run a controller which only works as a cheap timer he could buy in his nearest shop. But when it comes to take decissions based on events / sensor status, etc., then there is no possible comparison: OR outperforms any hardware controller.</p>

<p>The point is that, by the moment, this intelligence is only available to programmers which know the syntax of Drools.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interesting thoughts</p></font>

and the idea was not new too, in the forum is lots on connecting to Arduino, Raspberry, and lego see also: <a href="http://info.scratch.mit.edu/WeDo">http://info.scratch.mit.edu/WeDo</a><br/>
I think a rules-gui next to the devices and panels in OpenRemote Designer would be nice, and for those that don't like the idea to have their (security)rules on the host/cloud, to run on a local pc.  Will try to find some more time (will be hard for the coming weeks) to explore furher on this.</p></font>
