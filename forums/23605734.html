				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>In the past, I used to have OR KNX 1.4.2 installed on my iPhone 4 to control the lighting in my house.<br/>
After upgrading my PC and my iPhone4 to an iPhone 6 I managed to lose my OR KNX application (so I thought at least) as I could not re-install from AppStore.</p>

<p>It has maybe been removed because the developer JÃ¶rg Falkenberg so tragically passed away?</p>

<p>However, searching through my backups I found the IPA-file for my OR KNX 1.4.2 application and have successfully installed it on my iPhone 6 device. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I have also found several backups (XML files) of my OR KNX database on Google Drive (previously Google Docs).</p>


<p>Unfortunately I'm not able to RESTORE any of the XML backups through the OR KNX application feature (Import/Export).</p>

<p>Maybe because Google Docs is now Google Drive or because the OR KNX application is not 100% compatible with iOS 9.2.1?</p>

<p>Does anyone know, or have an idea, how to restore the XML file manually and to where it should be copied on the iOS device?</p>

<p>Can this be done using iTunes (12.X) or must some other tool be used?</p>

<p>Any idea or help is extremely welcome!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Regards<br/>
Joakim</p>
