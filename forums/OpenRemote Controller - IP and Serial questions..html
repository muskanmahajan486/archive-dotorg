				    <p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>This looks like a very interesting project. My hat goes off to all those involved!</p>

<p>My wife and I are currently in the process of designing and building our own home in Australia. I am planning on implementing systems to control lighting and power (using Clipsal CBUS), Security, Air Conditioning, Telephony as well as A/V distribution.</p>

<p>I came across the OpenRemote project while searching for a way to interface with and manage all of these components at an abstracted layer. As well as CBUS, I'm looking at a A/C system controlled via Serial as well as a series of components for 1080p HDMI distribution around the house. Not to mention some form of IP telephony...</p>

<p>There are a couple of suitable commercial offerings, such as that from Switch Automation (<a href="http://www.switchautomation.com.au">http://www.switchautomation.com.au</a>), however ideally I wanted to use something that didn't lock me into a specific black box or vendor.</p>

<p>I'm thinking that OpenRemote could be the answer? I've read though the literature on the website and noticed that IP and serial are mentioned, however the primary bulk of effort seems focused on  IR and KNX. Is there any current plans to include generic IP and Serial interfaces so that you can interface with and bidirectionally communicate with any third party IP or serial device?  I'm also a little fuzzy on exactly how the OpenRemote controller software would operate in this scenario. My expectation is that OpenRemote would open a socket to a tcp capable device on a given port and then use this socket to send and listen for commands. OpenRemote would thus maintain a state knowledge of connected devices by listening for events. Received events can be acted upon by by executing actions. So, OpenRemote is like the brains of the everything in an automation project, knowing how to communicate with the disparate devices and allowing events from one device to trigger an action on another. Perhaps a little high level, but does this functionality fall into OpenRemote's intended capabilities?</p>

<p>I've also been wondering if there is any plan to use floorplan layouts to control funcationlity? I really, really, really like the idea of having a touch screen with floorplan layout. You touch a room to make changes to devices in that room. So easy.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
Dray.</p>

<p>You are correct we are right now focusing on IR and KNX for our first 1.0 release. Generic IP and serial scripting has been discussed a lot, and we consider it fairly high on the priority list to make a usable product for do-it-yourself and professional installers. However, we haven't yet put a release target for it.</p>

<p>This is pretty close to how we see the controller evolve, yes.</p>

<p>As well, I think this is relevant probably for 2.0 release where we plan to target installers with modeler tool that lets you configure devices against a floorplan.</p>

<p>There's a lot of important functionality still to do. At the same time we want to release things out to community. For your specific items, look for the upcoming releases after 1.0 is out.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The floor plan is clearly something that we are working on and it seems to be a default way for many folks to represent their house and click generic on/off on the touch screen.</p>

<p>IP connection is also very present but there is always the problem of what we say to it, there is little standard there and we are building support for protocols as we go and people ask for them.&nbsp; The idea is that IR is pretty much everywhere and KNX is big and professional in EU.&nbsp; Excuse us while we focus on building a pro image through KNX, we will get to other stuff as time/priorityand money permit.&nbsp; We also hope to seed the project enough (with funding right now) that we would create the dynamics of "snow-ball" on support by vendors.</p>

<p>In other words, do you know what vendors you plan on putting in your home? You will need an integration/UI layer that integrates with them all. Have you researched this and do you mind sharing that list with us? You will certainly have IR in there... what about the lights? CBUS is known as a industrial solution, not really "home" but I could be wrong on customs in AU <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>Sorry for the extended delay in getting back to you - I've been researching so I have a greater understanding of what Open Remote trying to achieve for v1.</p>

<p>I can appreciate what you're trying to do by getting the product off the ground with KNX and IR.</p>

<p>The concept design I have for my automation system would utilise a GC100 serial or IP controller as opposed to a commandIR system. Are you able to tell the commandIR system to do something with one of it's IR emitters over an IP or serial connection, rather than having to do everything via remote control?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I'm going to use CBUS for lighting and power. In Austrlaia CBUS is the dominant residential smart lighting solution. It's supported and installed by most of the large project home builders. Dynalite and HMP iControl are also used. I'm planning on doing irrigation management and potentially security though CBUS as well.</p>

<p>The R/C Air Conditioning system is an Intelligent Life GEN III system with RS232 control.</p>

<p>AV distribution is still a little up in the air. I'm pretty sure the Video distribution system will be based around an HDMI matrix switch. I found one manufactured by a company in Taiwan (<a href="http://www.gomax-electronics.com.tw/Product/vcat5/MA5188/ma5188.htm">http://www.gomax-electronics.com.tw/Product/vcat5/MA5188/ma5188.htm</a>) that supports 1080p and 7.1 audio distribution over 2 x Cat5e or Cat6 (for greater run length) UTP cables and permits control via RS232. I'll probably have a Cable TV box, a Popcorn Hour type box and a few other bits and pieces hooked into the Matrix switch and then use a touch remote system (iphone, panel pc, whatever) to control source and output switching on the matrix switcher. Ideally I'd like to be able to browse movies on the popcorn hour via a touchscreen and choose which TV's I want them to appear on. Not sure about audio distribution yet, or how to handle telephony. Perhaps some Astrix based solution? I want to have IP Video intercoms too..</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, I was hoping that Open Remote would do this!!? OR would need to monitor and maintain a state of all the devices in my home so that it can intelligently respond to events based on received data sources. For example if I wanted turn off some lights in zone X when it got to 3pm when the temperative was over 25deg celcius OR would have to:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>know when it was 3pm</li>
	<li>poll the A/C system to get the temperative in zone X; this is because the AC system probably would not supply a system status data feed to OR but would rely on OR to use a GET/SET type approach. If the temp was over 25deg then</li>
	<li>check it's state data tables to determine if the lights were already off in zone X. It would know this because C-Gate is giving it a live feed. If light lights are on then OR would issue the appropriate command via socket to C-Gate</li>
</ul>


<p>From what I've read KNX defines a standard for interfacing with and controlling a device. It also provides different options for physical connectivity between these devices, however it's more about the interface and control protocol - is this correct? CBUS is similar in that it specifies a physical connectivity medium (over UTP or proprietary wireless) and defines a interface and control control standard between all CBUS capable devices. Clipsal, the manufacturer of CBUS here in Australia, announced in April 2009 that they are publishing the serial protocols for free use by developers. Have a look at <a href="http://www.cbus-enabled.com/news-8.htm">http://www.cbus-enabled.com/news-8.htm</a> for the full details. I'm positive that having these protocol documents available will make interfacing OR with CBUS much more palatable than before. Is there anything, besides the widespread EU adoption of KNX, that KNX has over CBUS?</p>

<p>It's probably noteworthy to mention that my plan was to always interface with CBUS via their C-GATE tool which bypasses the requirement to talk native CBUS. C-Gate is essentially a freely available daemon written and maintained by Clipsal that lives on a box that maintains a constant connection to the CBUS network either by IP or RS232. It can be used to instruct the CBUS network to perform various actions, e.g. turn on lighting group X, using formatted commands and responses via a telnet interface. C-Gate also has a number of options to allow third party applications to receive a continuous real time list of events that occur on the CBUS network. All this info came from: <a href="http://www.clipsal.com.au/trade/__data/page/81/C133.pdf">http://www.clipsal.com.au/trade/__data/page/81/C133.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>So, while the serial protocol specs are a great step forward in having totally accessible standards for CBUS that give you the option to create your own interface, in most cases you could probably just use C-Gate to do everything. There are a few exceptions, such as adversity to having a separate interface daemon that you have to run and rely on. Most of the flack I've read about C-Gate I've read focused around it's reliability, or lack thereof. It's seems to have matured in versions since those discussions though.</p>

<p>A quick answer, we will definitely have ways of doing all this. We don't have this right now but this will most definitely be added. Were working on that now but not for 1.0.</p>

<p>The talk right now is a rules based engine and/or Groovy as a scripting language. Nothing is written in stone yet, so nothing is being ruled out. I'm pushing for Groovy and it's not just as simple as selecting a scripting language. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

<p>We are approaching this slightly differently. The ORB is the controller and CommandIR (or GC for that matter) is an extension to it. The logic (our code) is in the ORB which then uses the extensions over various different media (IP, RS-232, USB). For the CommandIR example, we use its USB driver to control it from the ORB. CommandIR itself is not an IP-enabled device.</p>

<p>The ORB is an IP device, part of your home LAN. Our current reference implementations also include WiFi and the ORB responds to HTTP requests over IP network.</p>

<p>There are some cases (IP-based gateways) where we can control things directly from IP-enabled consoles (iPhone etc). For example, GC or IRTrans can be controlled directly via IP, many other products too. For some scenarios ORB is not necessary although we suspect over time having logic deployed on a controller (such as ORB) to react to events coming from other devices will change this. A lot of the higher end functionality that Neil and Dan C discuss are examples of this.</p></font>

<p>Is there anything, besides the widespread EU adoption of KNX, that KNX has over CBUS?</p></blockquote>

<p>No. At high level they serve same purpose in different markets, and are positioned the same relative to OR effort (integration and interoperability with legacy HA systems).</p>

<p>We have a very short entry on <a href="http://openremote.org/display/knowledge/C-Bus">C-Bus</a> in our knowledgebase. Since currently no one from the core team is situated in Australia, feel free to share experience and notes on C-Bus there, would be appreciated.

<p>I am a AMX and Crestron Programmer in Sydney and have some C-bus experience that I like to share. </p>

<p>In order to control C-bus, you will need have serial (RS-232) or network connection to the C-bus's interface. </p>

<p>I've developed a AMX module that controls the C-bus lighting with RS-232. You can obtain the protocol from their web site:
<a href="http://training.clipsal.com/downloads/OpenCBus/OpenCBusProtocolDownloads.html">http://training.clipsal.com/downloads/OpenCBus/OpenCBusProtocolDownloads.html</a></p>

<p>But if you want to develop application that can do everything with C-bus, then I think you will need to be a C-bus enabled partner. I think you will need to pay for the partnership.</p>

<p>I told the C-bus programming training 2 years ago which they give me a c-bus relay and PC interface in return. Please let me know if you guys want me to help for programming and testing with C-bus.</p></font>

<p>There are some cases (IP-based gateways) where we can control things directly from IP-enabled consoles (iPhone etc). For example, GC or IRTrans can be controlled directly via IP, many other products too.

A lot of the higher end functionality that Neil and Dan C discuss are examples of this.</p></blockquote>

<p>Exactly - ORB isn't necessary is some scenarios but you need to have something in place that ties all home automation systems together. That's really the trick isn't it? Having something in the middle that is agnostic to the devices it's interfacing with. This means you can effectively replace all the other devices interface systems with one ORB, plus you'd get the benefit of having a middleware system (ORB) that is able to effect a change in a one device based on the output from another, ala real home automation.</p></font>

<p>The documentation is great. I'm actually surprised that they have such good technical documentation freely available (and easy to find) online.</p>

<p>I haven't had any CBUS experience yet, but I will soon! I'm putting in a fairly exotic system to permit management of lighting and power though out my home. The theory is I'll be able to manage each light circuit (i.e. kitchen lights, hall lights, theatre lights, etc) as separate groups as well as monitor power usage per room, control ceiling fans and speeds, etc. Until ORB gets to a point where I can use it to monitor and trigger events based on CBUS notification messages I'll be using a thinggy called a PAC, which sits on the CBUS network and allows you to program in actions for monitored events. e.g. it's after 10pm and movement is detected in the hallway so turn the lights onto 25% there so if somoene is going to the bathroom they can see.</p></font>

<p>Do you mean a product that is C-Bus enabled, like one that you put on a CBUS network and it acts like another C-Bus device? Or are you referring to a software appliction that interfaces with C-Bus devices?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that you can use the serial protocols to develop a controller program if you wanted to interface directly with C-Bus, but as discussed earlier most of the heavy lifting for this task has already been coded into C-Gate, and if you have a running C-Gate instance you may as well talk via that (telnet) when controlling C-Bus.</p>

<p>As for C-Bus enabled hardware, I have no idea...</p>

<p>From my experience, the protocol that we can download from the web site cannot communicate with using IP. Besides, it can only control C-bus device within the local network but not remote network. I think you will need to be a C-bus enabled partner in order to obtain the full version of the protocol as well as their support for software development.</p>

<p>In openremote's situation, my feeling is it is easier to simply send RS-232 or IP command to C-bus within the same application instead of using C-gate. Besides, I am not sure if Linux can run C-gate or not.</p>
