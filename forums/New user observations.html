				    <p>Hello,<br/>
I have played around with OpenRemote for a few days now on my Android phone. I want to report my observations. First let me say that I think your have a very good project and there has been a lot of hard work. I am a computer and home theater hobbyist, not a programmer or professional installer. I have been experimenting with the iRule iphone and ipad commercial app, which I think is an excellent value at $50. I have also installed a Command Fusion sample program to control my Directv dvr over IP. So at the risk of being called an iRule fanboy, here goes <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>.</p>

<p>1. Your Boss online designer is excellent. It is very similar to irule's builder app. It seems very stable and doesn't need any significant change.</p>

<p>2. Marc Fleury posted that he is working on a serverless android app. I think this is a great idea. I don't run an HTPC and it would simplify things a lot to not have to turn on a computer and start a script. I think for Open Remote to go to mainstream users, this would need to be implemented. IRule and Commandfusion do not need to have a server running. Irule can use ip directly or the global cache ip to IR/serial/relay converters.</p>

<p>3. The ability to share buttons, panel designs, IR codes needs to be enhanced. In iRule there is a checkbox to allow sharing of your configuration.</p>

<p>4. Could you put up some well designed sample controls for a few common items like a cable or satellite dvr, blu ray player, roku, apple tv? iRule does this and it makes it really fast to add a device.</p>

<p>5. In your sample buttons, could you include a blank button? I am photoshop/gimp challenged, so if you had an easy way for me to quickly make a new button, that would be awesome. Also, could you add more buttons, with names of devices and rooms in the house?</p>

<p>6. I have UPB lighting in my house. There is an opensource project to support this at <a href="http://www.xpl4java.org/UPB4Java/">http://www.xpl4java.org/UPB4Java/</a>. If someone were to work on adding this to open remote, I would be happy to test it.</p>

<p>In summary, I think you should take a look at your commercial competition and see if they have features that you might want to add to OR. To be fair, iRule does not currently support 2 way communication, which I think OR does. It also does not have an Android app, which you do. Its price is not that bad compared to other universal remotes on the market. It does have a very "open" mentality in terms of users sharing codes and designs, although it is not open source software. Command Fusion is much more expensive and only available via dealers, but does 2 way and has an android app.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Jack, thanks for taking the time to give us the feedback.  Been noodling on this for a bit (also was in china for the past week and couldn't really answer)</p>

<p>1/ I actually think there is a bunch of room to improve on the tools.  But thanks for the kudos.  Most improvement should be around user experience. Right now the user sees an application.  You are familiar with what the application is supposed to do and the abstraction it supports, meaning devices, their physical representation and what the UI is supposed to do.  What we are finding here (even at OR which has a high pro participation) is that these are a bit advanced.  I think the narrative of webpages (start building UI, map to phy devices) would work well here. </p>

<p>2/ I agree with the point of serverless.  This is the main reason i started coding on android. However, I must admit that as time goes by I find this to be superficial.    Let me explain.  Yes, it is easy to get up and running without the server (altho the server installation here is not the most complicated <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>.  It gives you that nice feeling of low barrier to entry to get going.  For most HT scenarios, it will be sufficient to have one way communication as more than 80% of users out there only use IR to communicate with their HT set-up.  I think most of the RemoteCentral.com crowd really relates to this point as the focus is the remote.  With OR we aim to have a C4/Crestron like CPU in the middle.  For most industrial or commercial cases, it is a must.  2 way is easily implemented, monitoring, remote access, etc etc. KNX I think provides a good example where you can always talk remote-&gt;device but most vendors will bring in a CPU to do full automation. In other words, a PC like platform (could be android) is needed in most cases.  In the case of OR it is a free installation (GPL code).  In short, while the "initial contact" will always be easier in server-less most people will grow to ORB quickly. Don't get me wrong, simplicity first, complexity later is a better approach than complexity always AND a better approach than "only supports the simple scenarios"</p>

<p>3/ Yes, you are right about the sharing part.  Today beehive is still a bit closed, we haven't finished this.  There are demands for IR commands as well as icons etc.  We are working on this. Thanks for pointing it out.</p>

<p>4/ Yes, the templates thing is important and missing as is.  It is on our roadmap and some other folks have posted icons for us to use.  We will be making progress on this. </p>

<p>5/ sure</p>

<p>6/ Thanks for the link.  We all have a bit on our plates but depending on the complexity of this, we could look into implementing it.  Let us get back to you. WIll look at the UPB4Java and see if it is IP based.  </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>This looks like a great place to add my comments because a number of them directly follow Jack's ideas.&nbsp; I have only been playing with OpenRemote for a short while now, but I think it has the potential to be extremely powerful and flexible.</p>


<p>Jack's point #3) I know it is work in progress, but the ability to upload and share Codes &amp; panels is a must.&nbsp; I have been a big fan of RemoteCentral and their work on the Pronto remotes for a number of years (I am a proud TS1000 owner).&nbsp; Daniel's database for sharing IR codes is fantastic.&nbsp; I think I leared the remote codes for only two peices of equipment and downloaded coded for the other 30 components I had over the years.&nbsp; There were also many codes that were hacked to enable features like discrete input select and discrete power on/off that were not availible on the original remotes.</p>

<p>Jack's point #2) The serverless Android is a must as far as I am concerned.&nbsp; I understand the need for the KNX stuff in the installer community, but the barrier of entry it too high for the general consumer.&nbsp; With the GC iTach being around $100 with a built-in IR learner, serverless is a great option.&nbsp; I want to put identical copies of a remote on multiple android phones so I can watch distributed media throughout the house and control it. This gives me three universal remotes that work through walls for less than the price of one Harmony (if I already have the phones)</p>

<p>OK, here are the additions that I think would significantly help the product and the speed at which the databases can be populated with resources.</p>

<p>1) For IR codes, pick a single format for the central repository. (I like CCF because I am already comfortable with it and huge databases already exist)&nbsp; If you were to use a single format, you could write converters into OpenRemote Boss instead of trying to convert stuff on the fly.&nbsp; This would allow me to use a iTach setup and someone else to use a KNX setup.&nbsp; We would configure our panels with our transmit hardware and the compatible XML would be extruded.&nbsp; Solves the speed and horsepower issues and as new hardware emerges, one only needs to write a translator into Boss and it would be seemless.</p>

<p>Adding a discussion forum and moderation to sort out the IR database would be necessary too.&nbsp; I didn't like having 35 different versions of the learned codes from a DVD player because you never knew if the were complete or correct.</p>


<p>2) Properties/variables for Devices.&nbsp; I noticed by reading a number of examples in these forums that many commands use IP addresses that are hard-coded in the command stream.&nbsp; This would be determental to a code sharing database.&nbsp; But if the Devices themselves had vaiables that could be associated with them, then all someone has to do then importing a device is change a single field in their device and the commands would work for them.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; (From the DirecTV HR21 IP interface)&nbsp; <a href="http://192.168.1.99:8080/remote/processKey?key=rew&amp;hold=keyPress">http://<div class="error"><span class="error">Unknown macro: {HR21_IPAddress}</span> </div>:8080/remote/processKey?key=rew&amp;hold=keyPress</a></p>

<p>3) XML import for OpenRemote Boss.&nbsp; I have a white paper for the Denon AVR IP codes.&nbsp; There are a LOT of codes.&nbsp; I am very good at text manipulation and with a XML template, I could convert the code sheet over without needing to add commands indivdually.</p>

<p>4) In Open Boss, I love the grid, but it would be awesome if you could also drop tempates.&nbsp; This was a really useful feature in ProntoEdit that allows you to drop a complex transport or other multi-button field without having to realign images.&nbsp; Image drop can be used as a template in the meantime.&nbsp; This can go down towards the bottom of the list. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I am really smitten by the new platform.&nbsp; I am excited to mix direct IP control with IP2IR control and have it all running on my phone.&nbsp; Keep up the good work and I will try and contribute as much as my time allows&#33;</p>


<p>Thanks,</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Neil,</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. All are good ideas.</p>

<p>Regarding #1:</p>

<p>We will add CCF codes to beehive at some point, thanks to the work Bengt has done to patch LIRC to export CCF format. CCF to LIRC I think already exists and is a simpler conversion. These conversions will be done on the server side and this made directly available.</p>

<p>That's the first step, so we can have a joint set of infrared records included from both LIRC and CCF communities.</p>

<p>Second step is the single storage format for all infrared codes. Frankly this is less visible to users once bidirectional conversions are in place (you can go from LIRC to CCF or vice versa) but is more of a concern from the engineering perspective and desire to not have overlapping datasets. In practice this would mean that whether LIRC or CCF recording is imported, it is stored in some common (normalized) format. It's still not clear what such normalized format should be, given that LIRC seems to store more metadata about IR recordings compared to CCF for example, and then libDecodeIR.so seems to add additional metadata.</p>

<p>Guys who have worked more with IR code conversions may have proposals for such common format, for the time being I'm ok to have bidirectional conversions enabled as first step.</p>

<p>Regarding discussion, rating, moderation on recorded codes, yes this has been in the plans for quite a long time but we haven't really made the effort yet to expose it to users. In short, the recorded IR codes can already be versioned, committed/rolled-back as necessary, or even forked should it be necessary. Ratings and comments should be enabled with an integration of Beehive to the website and designer views.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Neil,</p>

<p>I addressed several of those issues a few months earlier, in <a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10551657">http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10551657</a>. Unfortunatelly without substantial feedback... My admiration for Remotecentral (or lirc for that matters) is limited, for reasons I develop in the quoted articles. Your #3 should be fairly close to the device description format I describe. Yes, I have that Denon document converted to machine readable XML format (NOT using CCF, but command numbers etc).</p>

<p>Having a "project" collecting reviewed "device description files" in a sane format (I have suggested one, can definitely be improved) using e.g. a canonical list of command names, having unambigous syntax (cf. Power/power_toggle/power_on&amp;/power_off from my ealier articles), describing devices (not remotes), etc, etc would be a great achivement. But the effort should&nbsp; not be underestimated...</p></font>

<p>I agree to all points above, but the #2 is a dealbreaker for me. Mainly because I simply don't want to be dependent on a machine running 24/7.</p>

<p>So if you have any unofficial beta which is "serverless", count me in as a tester. So far I'm controlling the receiver, TV, MAC and Ligthning (NEXA) and plan to remote the PS3 and Wii.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Sorry guys but serverless maybe a feature but is not the core of where this product is heading. Its obvious momentum is coming and things are clearly on the road map, and yes please take some cues from irule as for an out of the box solution its configuration could not be simpler. So I won't reiterate points above all are obvious and sure will be coming. </p>

<p>BUt back to the point to server or not? For me its a must, I'v had irule running for no more than a day and i'm already itching to find more control capability  and be able to program my devices to perform how I want them to perform and out of the way. Two way control etc etc... just needs a server to work especially with multiple remotes.</p>

<p>The issue to all of these limitations is simply State. You must have a server to be able to understand the state of your devices are in, and you for that matter, and be able to interface with them correctly, cope with multitude of users using them, and the scenario of people adjusting them outside of the application. Even in my two bedroom house with me and the wife I can see the limitations. </p>

<p>I must admit i'm little overwhelmed with OR but have almost got there, (a quick update of that todo section on GC-100's would be a great help), so as the Business Consultant/Analyst in me that I am heres a simple use case of what I want my system to do and clearly why you need a server, anyone wants to tell me where to start with this would be great. And how far OR is from this... </p>

<p>So Simple USe Case... <br/>
0. Watching the MAtrix film at night, cranked it up real loud with extra bass to feel bullets flying. <br/>
1. Switch off Amp with my foot on the power button (why use a remote when this is ten times quicker)<br/>
2. go to bed. <br/>
3. Wife wakes up picks up iphone remote, hits Watch TV<br/>
4. Cable box, tv, and AMp fire up, volume is set so and loud blows my speakers (IR this is true, but luckily i have rs232 so can make sure switch on sets volume no way i'm blowing my KEF's)</p>

<p>Dream use case.. </p>

<p>1. Get on bus to work tell house coming home<br/>
2. Temp control gets house to correct temp range 18-23 degrees celsius <br/>
3. Arrive Open front door, recognises I've arrived turns on lights to living room<br/>
4. Fires up a web page on the tv with latest headlines from my favourite rss news feeds<br/>
5. Wifes reminder pops up and tells me its garbage night take it out.. <br/>
5. Shout "HOuse" play Genius Rock list" music starts playing where i am from itunes<br/>
6. Walk into bedroom music follows me to bedroom, lights cvome on automatiucally, get changed. <br/>
7. Walk back into lounge music follows me, bedroom lights go off)<br/>
8. System reminds me take out garbage (as knows i havent walked outside yet)<br/>
9. Take out rubbish, come back in SHout "House Chore Garbage Done"<br/>
10. Pick up remote press watch TV, music stops, tv turns on. <br/>
11. Button on remote shows me the program currently on and whats next<br/>
12. Click Sports, Lounge amp changes to Sports Surround mode<br/>
13. Click Watch Film check cinema mode, projector drops down tv switches off, projector drops out of ceiling, switches on, XBMC fires up, watch film<br/>
14. Goto bed, press House Sleep, everything switches off, lights switch off, ect... </p>


<p>Second case, which is again the biggest deal breaker for me is, as nice as touch screen smart phones and ipads are there no replace for the good old feel of a remote control with rubber push buttons. So I need a system that I can hook up to receive IR commands and execute appropriately. </p>

<p>So back to the post of new user observations heres a couple that I have or would like to know if there coming. </p>

<p>1. Zigbee remote control integration... or Infrared receiver commands to execute macros etc<br/>
2. Integration to my other favourite open source software XBMC. (not control) full integration, browse library, plugins etc etc... <br/>
3. Event Programming, (Say add Holiday program to turn lights etc on or off while your away), HOuse initiation program to turn lights on and play musix specific to teh time and day of the week and season of the year???<br/>
4. Itunes integration, acces to browse playlist etc... <br/>
5. Server UI for clients to setup events or basic changes without being a designer / developer... Like add a routine to turn lights on off when going on holiday. <br/>
6. Onscreen control from remote control like control4 with zigbee remote. </p>


<p>Basically I want Control4 without the hassle and cost of paying some installer to configure the thousand and one things I want to do and pay $200 for them to add a light switch... </p>

<p>Love the start, look forward to the evolution... and possible career change when it gets up to speed installing the future into homes of the rich and timeless without paying $200 per remote to control 4 to add the iphoine software per device... Criminal... or $900 for a cheap linux box that should be $100. </p>

<p>Keep it up and i'll be watching, but for now irule will keep me amused but not for long. I may have to get some of my developers to look into the source code next time we have a gap between a couple of projects. </p>

<p>And finally if anyone still thins why you need a server, go see a pro installation demo, and you'll see where were heading,  </p>
