				    <p>I have an <a href="http://www.globalcache.com/products/itach/wf2irspecs/">iTach WF2IR</a> controlling it with OpenRemote from my iPhone which works excellent. I control my TV, Receiver and MAC Mini running Plex which are placed in a cabinet so no IR signal can reach them.</p>

<p>However, sometimes I simply don't have the iPhone close (battery outage/loading). Also, sometimes (my wife <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>) simply thinks controlling the MAC using the standard Apple Remote is easier, which I can agree on since having "real" buttons rather than touchscreen is sometimes more easier to handle (but not as cool).</p>

<p>Of course, I could go ahead and buy any "IR extender" device on the market to extend the IR signal to the MAC inside the cabinet, but I was wondering if OpenRemote/iTach could do it for me?</p>

<p>So before I go ahead and buy an <a href="http://www.globalcache.com/products/other/">IR Receiver</a> and connect it to the iTach, my question is if OpenRemote can receive the IR signal and translate it into commands to my MAC Mini?</p>

<p>There's a "Sensor" in the Designer but can't figure out how I would configure it. I've read the User Reference for Sensors.</p>

<p>Short answer: out-of-the-box no.</p>

<p>This will require some healthy tweaking on your part. The controller will understand commands sent over HTTP.  You'll need some program or script on the Mac that generates these HTTP requests. Then you'll need something that can take the incoming IR command on Mac and execute your little program or script. One example that might work (have not tried any of this) is here: <a href="http://twistedmelon.com/mira/screenshots.html#mainwindow">http://twistedmelon.com/mira/screenshots.html#mainwindow</a></p>

<p>There are other similar products out there if you google a bit. The HTTP commands OR controller understands are described here: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Controller+2.0+HTTP-REST-XML#Controller2.0HTTP-REST-XML-SendWriteCommand">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Controller+2.0+HTTP-REST-XML#Controller2.0HTTP-REST-XML-SendWriteCommand</a></p>

<p>(Sorry for hijacking this thread)</p>

<p>Nice to hear from you again &#8211; we were in fact talking about you today <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> I was planning to ping you just to say Hi.</p>

<p>Eric Bariaux is looking at Pronto XCF IR conversions to IRP notation &#8211; he said he found you had also done some work in this area? We were looking at options for storing and converting IR recordings between systems.</p>

<p>nice to hear. Don't draw too many conclusions from the fact that I have not posted here the last year or so, I have been busy... What Eric saw was probably IrpMaster, a library/program (see <a href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=13396">this thread at the JP1-forum</a>) I recently wrote that can generate "arbitrary" IR signals from a high-level ("IRP") description. As a Java library, it is meant to be flawlessly integrate-able in the controller and in beehive (or modeler). You will see more in the near future...</p></font>

<p>Yes indeed it was IrpMaster I looked at.</p>

<p>Basic idea is that IR codes in Beehive would only store the fundamental information required to re-generate the code (e.g. RC5, system, command).<br/>
Your library could then be used to take that code and generate a "raw" signal that can then be converted to the appropriate format for the blaster in use.</p>

<p>I'll certainly either post or contact you once my idea are a bit clearer on the big picture and I'm eager to hear what you're up to (now that you teased us)</p></font>
