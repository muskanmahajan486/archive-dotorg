				    <p>I just read on the Zwave&gt;Me forum about a variant of the Danfoss Living Connect radiator valve: <a href="http://en.z-wave.me/comment/605#comment-605">http://en.z-wave.me/comment/605#comment-605</a>. They seem to make a distinction between a version for their Link Connect and a Zwave device.<br/>
Anybody here who has more precise pointers to the specifics of the new device?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>generally the information is correct. The "old" Danfoss  model has two stacks inside, one for the Danfoss proprietary system and one for Z_Wave. This has been split into two<br/>
single stack products. Unfortunately the roll out was not perfect. the non Z-Wave version was launched and the old model discontinued. The new Z-Wave only version is not yet available. We(www.zwaveeurope.com) have an arrangement with Danfoss to be able to ship the old model as long as needed and we will also be able to deliver the new model (Samples we have on stock). This this regard the statement above (only OEMs) is fortunately not 100 % correct.</p>

<p>Regards</p>

Thank you for this feedback. It is reassuring to now that we as casual users will have access to the OEM stock. Do you know if Danfoss has done anything to the Z-Wave control, or is it exactly the same as in the old devices? I am asking, because many people on different fora are complaing about the long time between submitting a temperature setpoint change and the actual change in the controlling valve. I have seen reports of 1 to 9 hours delay. This long delay is unacceptable for people who regularly come home at unexpected times, and want a rapid warming up. </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>the firmware was not changes. the delay may have two reasons. (1) The new setpoint will be transferred only when the devices wakes up and this depends on the wakeup interval the user/the software has defined.<br/>
(2) the radiator may start moving the valve but it can not be heard. there is a quite complex algorithm in the background that is sometimes moving big parts (noise) or sometimes moving 100 times ad small part ( no noise). This may confuse the user.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is not completely clear to me what the exact differences (concerning functions) are between the 'all-in-one' sw 2.06 and the new versions. Were these new versions developed because of failing functionality/bugs in either the Zwave-part or the Danfoss CC-part?</p>

<p>Refrase: <br/>
1) Does 2.06 do the exact same thing on the Danfoss Link CC side as the new Danfoss-only version?<br/>
AND<br/>
2) Does 2.06 do the exact same thing on the Zwave side as the new Z-wave-only version?</p>

<p>I am planning to buy 9 DLC's and a LinkBR to setup my system (already have LinkCC, LinkRS and one DLC 2.06), first use Danfoss LinkCC and later when there is good Homeseer(3? Whenever that will be...) support or any other Zwave-solution that lets me create my own touchscreen-interfaces.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Jasper</p></font>

<p>It seems there are different versions of LinkCC as well. You have to ask Danfoss for this, and you better ask them to confirm in writing! So you better know that your combo is supposed to work well together. Unfortunately Danfoss is not very good in customer relations to put it mildly.</p>
<blockquote><p>2) Does 2.06 do the exact same thing on the Zwave side as the new Z-wave-only version?</p></blockquote>
<p>As Christian says the new Zwave-only has the same Zwave functionality. The higher version number (2.50) only reflects the fact that the Danfoss specific functionality has been taken out. </p>

<p>We would appreciate if you publish your experiences with Danfoss here, or at least leave us with a reference to a description. Danfoss LC is an intriquing device with a lot of potential, but it also has, as can be seen on the different fora, caused a lot of agony in the home automation world</p></font>
