				    <p>Hi, finally I managed to run OR and right now I play with it, with a wide smile on my face <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Really great concept and really great realization! Thanks for this great software and thanks for making it Open Source. However I have some bug reports and toughs I want to share:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The switch button behaves strange. When it's pressed for a first time it leads to a login screen, no matter what command is attached to it.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The generated XML output is not unicode, which is a serous drawback.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The created elements in the UI Designer and Building Modeller must be made reusable. Now you have to create a separate command and a separate sensor to each device. Now imagine you have 30-40 devices that are same model and only thing that differs is their address. Each of these devices have same commands, sensors, sliders, switches and so on. Why not just create one "device type" with parameters like "address" and others, and then just copy it or use it like a template to create devices of that type.</li>
</ul>


<p>In UI Designer the re-usability of images is also a drawback. Why you have to upload same image each time you use it in a control? You already have it on the server after the first upload. Just select it and use it. This will optimize the time of creating UI and also will minimize the bandwidth and the time to load the interface on the panels. Now every image you upload has a different name and is used just once in the UI, no matter if the same image is already there and already loaded.</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>I mention it before, but I do it here also: there is a lack on a fine positioning of the controls in the UI designer. I mean to say there must be positioning on a pixel level. Dragging with the mouse is not so accurate. A fields X, Y, Width, and Height will do the job perfect.</li>
</ul>



<p>This are my thoughts after some play with OR and my custom hardware I made on a RS-485 bus. Right now the tests I made are simple - just turn ON and OFF a LED. I hope next week my modules will be completely ready and I could test OR with some sensors and more complex controls.</p>

<p>I really want to say it one more time - this is a great software and I'm sure it has a very bright future! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Mihail,</p>

<p>Thanks for trying the new app, and sending the feedback.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>This sounds odd. Could be an issue still with the security settings in your Tomcat instance (why it falls back to login screen).</p>

<p>I've used switch with KNX, recorded it here: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+KNX+Switches" title="OpenRemote 2.0 How To - KNX Switches">OpenRemote 2.0 How To &#45; KNX Switches</a>. I am guessing you're using one of the generic protocols (HTTP or TCP/IP) though? I haven't tried those yet.</p>

<p>I'll release a new developer binary next couple of days, will look at the default security settings there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The generated XML output is not unicode, which is a serous drawback.</p></blockquote>

<p>Can you expand what you mean by this? UTF-8 vs UTF-16, or something else?</p>

<p>There's a lot more work on the tooling side that remains to be done. Expanding template functionality is one of them. Import for protocols that support discovery is another item.</p>

<p>Agreed. You may have noticed there are some fixed images from Beehive that you can choose from. This should eventually be expanded to manage user's own images as well.</p>

<p>Yes. A current workaround is to create a grid and place your component there. You can position it with pixel accuracy and you can have multiple grids in your design.</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Yes, I use TCP/IP. The strange thing is that the problem existed only the first time. After I loged in yesterday, everything works right now.</li>
</ul>



<p>Can you expand what you mean by this? UTF-8 vs UTF-16, or something else?</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>I see you use UTF-8 in XMLs, however the Cyrillic characters don't encode right:<br/>
------<br/>
&lt;item name="???????"&gt;<br/>
  &lt;navigate toGroup="2" toScreen="16" /&gt; <br/>
  &lt;image src="field1283174837713.png" /&gt; <br/>
&lt;/item&gt;<br/>
------</li>
</ul>


<p>I think the problem is by saving the XML from the Designer. I will investigate this problem later today.</p>
