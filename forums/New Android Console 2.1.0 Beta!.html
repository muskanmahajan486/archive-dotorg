				    <p>Folks,</p>

<p>I've spent some time trying to improve some of the issues with the existing Android Console and now 2.1.0 beta is available to try: -</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/01ibptjotwgqlc6/Android_Console_2_1_0.apk">Android Console 2.1.0 Beta</a></p>

<p>Some of the notable changes: -</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Various improvements to general code and stability</li>
	<li>System Screens updated (now look a lot like the Webconsole system screens)</li>
	<li>Controller availability indicator added</li>
	<li>History management improved</li>
	<li>Slider re-written to avoid display issues with varying display densities</li>
	<li>Minimum Android version increased to 7 (Android 2.1) - necessary for some of the functionality now used</li>
</ul>


<p>Usage: -</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Controller auto-discovery is automatic</li>
	<li>Load a controller by tapping it in the controller list</li>
	<li>Remove controller's by holding down on them in the controller list and selecting delete when prompted</li>
	<li>You can edit a controller by clicking the '&gt;' image on the right hand side (Username and password is still to be implemented but default panel works)</li>
	<li>Only controller's that are available can be loaded</li>
</ul>


<p>A branch with the code can be found at: -</p>

<p>One question though, the display is 1024x600 which is displayed correctly but any "Android" panels that I create in Designer only fill about 1/4 of the screen! As the designer doesn't seem to have a way of defining screen resolution, is there a way that I can use the whole screen?</p>

<p>Ignore that, I just found the custom panel option!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for all of your work on this. It is a step in the right direction. (Love the ability to do the higher screen res.) I have run into some issues with my setup. However, my setup may not be considered normal. I'm running an HP Touchpad running CyanogenMod Android 4.0.4. Here are the results in my case (just thought I'd report it):</p>

<p>I have several panels created. 1 for a iPad (my main app). This will load one screen in Portrait mode only, then crash if I try to select anything. In Landscape mode the app will start to load and then return to the select controller screen. In one "menu", if I try to select something, the program crashes.</p>

<p>Another panel is a very basic, Android (higher res) attempt. Seems to run ok in Portrait mode but also bombs out in Landscape mode, returning back to the select controller screen.</p>

<p>Two panels that I've written for an Android phone (i.e. low res) will also only work in Portrait mode. They seem to run ok in this mode, however the second you switch to Landscape mode, the screen bombs out to the select controller page.</p>

<p>Again... thanks for all of your work on this.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for this update. I am happy that it is aligned more with webconsole now. This console loads much faster than the Webconsole on my desktop. As reference I have included a screenshot from the PC Webconsole, and one from the Android. (Sorry I do not know how to make a screenshot on a Android 4.0.3 tablet. Standard keys did not work, so I took my camera)<br/>
I noticed the following:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The webview elements (the round dial in the screendump) have a white background square instead of being transparant. There also seems to be a vertical misalignment of elements that are place on top of an other. I can only properly assess that when the webview background is transparant.</li>
	<li>The grey background image on the righthand side has been shifted quite a bit to the left</li>
</ul>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thank you Richard.</p>

<p>The new version is a big step in the right direction. I have longed for a fix of my resolution problems and this version solved most of them.</p>

<p>I still get wrong resolution on my Webview pages.<br/>
A image in the Webview appear much larger than they are in reality. For example, to get a webpage to fit in a Webview at 800x430, I have to create it in a resolution of 533x287.</p>

<p>Then I also have the problem that as soon as I change between landscape and portrait view, I get thrown back to the select cotroller page.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Awesome work Rich, tnx! Works well on my Galaxy Note 2, doing a lot of redesigning now that the resolution is correct, happy happy! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>One thing I've noticed is that when going out of controller and back in again it check for controllers and then a green checkbox "controller ok" comes up next to the controller. However, even if I've set a standard panel and there's only one controller, it still requires me to click the controller in order to connect. Shouldn't it auto-connect to default controller so that it's more seamless to enter OR from "desktop"? Minor nuisance but the only flaw I found so far due to not using landscape or web views yet.</p>

<p>One question though, since I'm not an Android developer myself. Wouuld it be a huge development effort on your part for the user to be able to select if he/she wanted proper fullscreen or choose the ability to display the top Android menu? The reason I'm asking is that I use OR as my XBMC remote and therefore it would be nice to see notifications etc on top. Not at all a showstopper, would just be nice to have the option at least.</p>

<p>Again, big tnx, huge improvement for me!</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>There is no way of specifying a default controller at the moment but if you load a particular controller and panel and then close the application (not using the back button as that will go to the Controller List) when you restart it will try and load the previous controller and panel which gives you the functionality you describe.</p>

<p>It would be straight forward to add a way of controlling the title bar to the app but most people seem to prefer full screen, easy enough to compile a version with the title bar shown if you want.</p>

<p>Regarding the un-install; the reason this happens is that I used a new key to sign the app as I don't know where the original one is. For the actual release then we can sign it with the same key hopefully so the new version will just replace the old.</p>

<p>I can confirm that the Web View looks perfect for me now.</p>

<p>And changing orientation dosen't pushes me back to the controller list, but unfortunately it pushes me back to the start screen.</p>

<p>A feature that I miss from the previous version is "press images" on the buttons. (Button image changes a bit when you press on it).</p></font>

<p>I have a vertical slider made from the "green led" image (ROTATEBarGraph24Off.png and the On version). I use it as a level indicator. I can however move the setpoint up and down and see the physical effect on screen. It goes wrong at low levels, where the lower part does show light green, then there is a part black, followed by a row af darkened leds.</p></font>

<p>I have been developing mostly with my Galaxy S3 running 4.1.2, also tested on several emulated devices with varying display densities and the screen sizing works as expected. When you say screens are shrunk I'm guessing that labels etc. look small, this is because components on the screen are sized using pixels so the higher your device's display density the smaller the screen components will look (slider's are sized using DIP units so they change their size to match your display but still the absolute layout or grid layout that contains the slider are sized by pixels).</p>

<blockquote><p>2. videostream in WebView element does not work;</p></blockquote>
<p>Not changed the webview apart from scaling and background color so not sure why this has stopped working, maybe there is a special permission for this so I will check.</p>

<blockquote><p>3. background images are not displayed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will look into background images</p>

<blockquote><p>Sliders doesn't work. They show always max value and when you try to adjust them, it sets minimum value(and still shows max value.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sounds like your get command isn't working but your set command is, not an issue with the Console but your Controller config.</p>

<blockquote><p>Is it possible to make the app always starts on the start page?</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people prefer the app to load the previous panel; but the only way to allow both options is to have a setting that can be toggled this would need to be added.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have a vertical slider made from the "green led" image (ROTATEBarGraph24Off.png and the On version). I use it as a level indicator. I can however move the setpoint up and down and see the physical effect on screen. It goes wrong at low levels, where the lower part does show light green, then there is a part black, followed by a row af darkened leds.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pieter can you email me your designer zip file and I can check your issues out as the web view background should now be transparent.</p>

<blockquote><p>And changing orientation dosen't pushes me back to the controller list, but unfortunately it pushes me back to the start screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have this problem on my Sumvision tablet but strangely not on other devices so I will look into this.</p>

<p>Thanks Rich, I'll continue using this (titlebar version) and see if I find any bugs or similar.</p>

<p>The new version has stabilised switching between the two panels i have configured (happens a lot atm as one is stable and the other beta), that was so and so before.</p>

<p>So, a HUGE tnx on both accounts.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for the new version.</p>

<p>Now I got rid of my problems with changing the orientation, pushes me back to the controller list.</p>

<p>A new problem that I have found (even in the previous version) is.</p>

<p>If I'm not connected to the Internet through WiFi, and instead connect using 3G, I can not connect to the controller through the controller list.</p>

<p>If I first start the app connected through WiFi and then exit the app with the Home button, then I can start the app, even if I am connected through 3G (because it jumps directly to where I was when I quit).</p>

<p>But if I have quit with back button instead, next time the app starts with "the controller list." I get the checkmark that it finds the controller, but then when I try to connect, it says "Controller is not available." The only way to proceed is to connect using WiFi again.<br/>
(I hope you can understand what I mean, otherwise ask and I can try to explaining a little bit better.)</p>

<p>After I've tried to connect through 3G and then connect using WiFi again it also starts to load all images (as if I had pressed "clear image").</p>

<p>Then I still have the wish that the buttons should change color when you press them, just as the switches do.</p></font>

<p>I'll look into the WIFI /3G connection issue when I get a chance; but to clarify your controller is accessible from the internet (i.e. you have the port forwarded on your router and you have the controller in the controller list using your WAN IP).</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks!<br/>
Button pressed state works for me now <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Nothing important, but is it possible (and fairly easy) to get the switches and buttons to change to the same color?</p>

<p>"to Clarify your controller is accessible from the Internet (ie you'll have the port forwarded on your router and you have the controller in the controller list using your WAN IP)."</p>

<p>Yes, it is accessible from the internet.<br/>
If I install the old 2.0.0 Beta3 again, then I can connect without prolem through 3G.<br/>
And if I first start the app connected through WiFi and then exit the app with the Home button, then I can start the app connected through 3G (because it jumps Directly to where I was when i quit). Everything works as it should.</p>

<p>But it is when I am connected via 3G and goes to the controller list, I get the problem. I get the checkmark in the controller list, that it has found the controller. It is when I press the controller in the controller list, something goes wrong. (after a while it says "Controller is not available").<br/>
(I use dynamic DNS from DynDNS)</p></font>

2. OR backing out to panel/controller selection and then when selecting a panel (i have two) it goes black and crashes after a while. When restarting OR everything works fine again.</p>

<p>Both issues (def the 2nd one) seem to be related to loosing wifi connectivity and then reconnecting when connected to wifi again (ie, returing home).</p>

<p>Side note, the release with titlebar that I'm using is awesome Rich, big thanks for that. I'd love for you to keep supplying a titlebar version when releasing updates.</p></font>

<p>I'm getting frequent crashes. Generally when moving from one screen to another I get "Unfortunately, OpenRemote has stopped". Usually I can just restart the console and its okay. I'm using the 2.0.2 version of the controller. These crashes occur on every Android device I've tried.</p>

<p>One thing I did have happen after installing the new android app was that everything is about half the size when it appears on my device compared to the designer. Any ideas how to fix this? The screen resolutions match so that is not the problem.</p>

<p>Also, after installing the android app, moving from screen to screen is very slow - not snappy like it was with the previous version of the app and other apps on my device.</p></font>

I submit that the problem below is not specific to this version.<br/>
But may be this new version might fix it.<br/>
I repost here the original text.</p>

<p>I installed OpenRemote-2.0. to control heating, lighting and extinguishing lamps, and up and down the shutters.<br/>
I use mochad and development for temperature sensors based on a server ARexx.<br/>
I used two types of machines to install the server in ubuntu<br/>
I started on a machine with a processor X686, where it works well.<br/>
and now Machine Hercules ECAFE with Processor ARM A8 CortexTM , diskless, with low power consumption.<br/>
I use it with android 4.0 phone<br/>
With ECAFE, the charging time is too long, and Android shows me<br/>
"Current controller Is not available"<br/>
After it works very well with all pannels that has already in memory.<br/>
I installed a proxy to trace the exchanges to open the remote server.<br/>
sending<br/>
GET / controller / rest / panel / HTTP/1.1 Telephone</p>

<p>receipt of the response to the proxy after 13 seconds:<br/>
&lt;? xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?&gt;<br/>
&lt;OpenRemote xmlns = "http://www.openremote.org" xmlns: xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns: schemaLocation = "http://www.openremote.org / panel.xsd "&gt;<br/>
   &lt;screens&gt;<br/>
     &lt;screen id="19" name="Acceuil"&gt;<br/>
       &lt;Grid left="36" top="399" width="250" height="50" rows="1" cols="5"&gt;<br/>
         &lt;cell x="4" y="0" rowspan="1" colspan="1"&gt;<br/>
           &lt;button id="776" name=""&gt;<br/>
             &lt;default&gt; ....... etc ...</p>

<p>The android does not seem to wait 5 seconds</p>



<p>Thank's</p></font>

In the Android previous version I get the Can't get panel ID. In the new version <br/>
never got a green check mark even using the explicit IP and also the DDNS.<br/>
It does not work from my S2,my S3 and Galaxy Tab2 over 3G. Using WiFi it is OK. I am not the only one to camplain. I have tested it from abroad (where I am now).<br/>
I think there is a bug. The common thing is the new controller.</p></font>

<p>Which version of controller you have?<br/>
To my best understanding, the problem is 2.0.2 controller. If you are using the previous version then I am correct. It is a bug inthe new version.<br/>
Further more, the new controller version down not work with more then one console at the time.</p>

<p>Please let me know what version you are running.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks, the update is a big improvement.<br/>
However I am also experiencing problems with images:<br/>
I placed a large image (not background), and a few buttons on top.<br/>
Only a few pixels of the image appear on the top left.</p>

<p>When I put the image as a background image, it appears but the scaling is different as in the designer: Designer scales to fit width, while the android app scales to fit height.</p></font>

<p>This is what the panel looks like in the Designer. The panel takes up the entire screen.</p>

<p><img src="attachments/21856835/22053032.jpg" align="absmiddle" border="0"/></p>

<p>And here is what it looks like on my device, a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The panel takes up only about one quarter of the screen.</p>

<p><img src="attachments/21856835/22053033.jpg" align="absmiddle" border="0"/></p>

<p>Before 2.0.1 the sizes matched.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to fix this. Yes, the resolution in the Designer matches the resolution of the phone.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></font>

<p>2 weeks after I had installed the Jelly Bean (4.1.2) on my Samsung S2, I got a bug fix update. After I installed it, all data traffic over 3G stopped working. I went to the website of my operator and asked them to send new data settings to my mobile. When I had got them, all data traffic began to work including the new Open Remote app.</p>

<p>I have no idea if it was bugfix release, or if it was the new settings that made OR to work over 3G.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I have some observations about the couple new versions floating around these forums. The 3 versions I've tried today are OpenRemote-2.0-Android_SNAPSHOT_20111012.apk (from the z-wave tutorial), Android_Console_2_1_0.apk (from the latest link above) and Android_Console_2_1_0_TitleBar (from above.) The snapshot version is the one that I would be using right now if it wasn't missing the tab bar. It fixed the the issue I had with button images being too small, and has the nicest looking settings screen. The only issue I had with the other two stems from the fact (I believe) that even though my nexus 7 has a 800x1280 resolution, I think the title and navigation bar use some of those pixels. So my 800x1280 designer screens with background set to "fill" were actually cropped or covered up by the nav bar at the bottom when using the old Android app. When using the TitleBar version it, as expected, cropped my background at the top when set to "fill." It appears though that Android_Console_2_1_0.apk crops the same amount of pixels as the TitleBar. Of course all that is fixed by setting the background position relative to the top, so my unused space at the bottom is cropped. All that being said, I'm using the TitleBar version and the only thing I'd change so far is add the settings screen from the snapshot version.</p></font>

<p>As and when I can spare some time I will try and implement any bug fixes that I can; the latest APK that is available is simply a patch on an older less stable console and there are some definite gremlins lurking in the code. This coupled with the huge variation in Android devices on the market and the differences in behaviour exhibited across even the the same version of android make reproducing issues a little tricky (this is where I am envious of the Apple model).</p>

<p>If I can replicate a bug then I can resolve it otherwise it is very difficult (and potentially time consuming) so the more information people provide the higher the priority assigned to the issue will be.</p>

Using the standard 8080 port should be fine, I personally wouldn't bother with the VPN, instead I would use the standard HTTP Basic authentication which can be set in the Tomcat configuration file and the web.xml of the controller. I would then just open a port on your router to route TCP traffic on port 8080 to your controller IP address inside your LAN, if you do not have a static IP from your ISP then most routers allow you to use dyndns or no-ip to provide you with a domain name that maps to your dynamic IP, you could then access your controller using a URL like <a href="http://myhouse.dyndns.org:8080">http://myhouse.dyndns.org:8080</a>.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Richard</p>

<p>I was playing with this app on my 2.3.5 android and all works well. But when I tried this app on 4.0 android, one annoying bug has appeared. </p>

<p>Let me explain. Let say that my phone is in landscape orientation. I open app choose controller and then panel. But the next step, here is a problem. If panel's fist screen has set only portrait orientation, this screen doesn't appear but I'm thrown back to the fist app screen when I can choose controller. If panel's first screen has set only landscape orientation all goes well.</p>

<p>I reviewed the code but I couldn't find where could be a problem. Any suggestions.</p>


<p>Next question is related with using this app on tablet that doesn't have menu button. This is a problem because I can't call tab bar menu. So the question is how to make tab bar menu constantly on the screen? </p>

<p>If you can, please be specific where in code I can do these changes.</p>


<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
Nejc</p></font>

(Axis uses MJPEG to transfer the images) On my computer in the webbrowser it works perfectly but on Android it just shows a black picture. On iOs only the first picture is displayed (there is no refresh) I found out that the Android WebView does not support MJPEG, but there is a class that should be able to stream MJPEG: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-camera-axis/source/browse/trunk/serealisation/src/de/mjpegsample/MjpegView/MjpegView.java?r=33">https://code.google.com/p/android-camera-axis/source/browse/trunk/serealisation/src/de/mjpegsample/MjpegView/MjpegView.java?r=33</a></p>

<p>Would it be possible to implement this class into the android app? I suppose this would require an additional property for the webview or a whole new UI element.</p></font>

I must add a nuance to that statement: it was the slider used as a level indicator that work for me. <br/>
I can't change the slider position (value) if I push the up down arrows. It does work on the WEB console. For temperature settings and the likes, I need small increments. That does not work well with the 'thumb' of the slider. <br/>

If you are connected via wifi and then switch over to 3g/4g the app crashes. If you load it again under 3g/4g it runs fine until you switch back to wifi. </p>

<p>I monitor my router to see if devices are present on the wifi to identify if someone is present at home. I discovered this while testing by switching my internet connection between wifi to 3g/4g. The web controller does not have this issue.</p>

<p>It has been a while since there has been an update to the Android app. I could attempt to tackle this problem myself if there are no objections. Where is the source for the version on the play store?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>OK, I have found what I think is a reasonable fix to my issue and thought others may appreciate it.</p>

<p>I got the source for "Android_Console_2_0_0_Beta3" and made a change to the "PollingHelper" class. It turns out there was a SocketException caused by the brief disconnection caused when wifi is switched to 3g/4g and vice versa. This appears to be a problem with how network exceptions are handled. When a SocketException occurs the code doesn't seem to cater for a split second outage. It looks like the issue is with the ORConnection.Java or ORNetworkCheck.Java. What these classes seem to do is try all possible reasons except there not being a connection. They eventually result in a thrown error which crashes the app.</p>

<p>I didn't have time to go through this code to fix this logic, so I have made a change to the PollingHelper.Java file which is the only place that I have seen affected by this issue.</p>

<p>The code I edited is in the "handleRequest" method. I have commented out two lines of the SocketException catch, shown below....</p>


<p>}catch (SocketException e) {<br/>
        if (isPolling)<div class="error"><span class="error">Unknown macro: {
       		//isPolling = false;
       		Log.e(LOG_CATEGORY, &quot;polling [&quot; + pollingStatusIds +&quot;] failed.&quot;, e);
       		//handler.sendEmptyMessage(NETWORK_ERROR);
      	}</span> </div><br/>
}</p>

<p>This prevents the app from crashing and allows polling to continue when SocketExceptions occur.</p>

<p>If anyone has a better way of fixing this, then great. Please let me know.</p>

<p>On another note, it seems that development on the Android app has ceased. Are we permitted to take the code and build our own apps based on that? I will need an Android app to offer with the service I intend to offer and don't really want to give people something that I know is buggy. </p></font>

<p>Thanks for looking into the cause of the issues you have been experiencing; it would seem that some work is needed on the PollingHelper class but at least you have managed to make a suitable patch.</p>

<p>Development/bug fixing on the Android Console happens whenever I can spare some time, but firstly we need to record these issues in our JIRA system: -</p>

1) Fixed image loading so that out-of-memory errors are less likely. This required a rework of the image loading technique so that images are not double loaded. Also improved image caching (I think).<br/>
2) Added a scale factor to the Console Connection dialog so that my layouts will work on any resolution Android. One layout can now be used across multiple Android devices.<br/>
3) Made the Android back button work like a back button.</p>

<p>Since I made my changes I see that r10098 and r10124 were made to the original baseline. </p>

<p>I have no problem sharing my code base back to the community. You can pick and choose from the changes I made and reintegrate them into the code base if you wish.</p>

<p>BTW I seldom have any crashes since changing how images are loaded. Your post about the SocketException may fix what few crashes I am getting.</p></font>

Not sure how you did it, but it would probably good to have a scale_x and scale_y parameter. Some of my android devices have physical buttons and some do not and thus the adjustment is different for x vs y.</p>

<p>To me, the real issue is scaling the XML coordinates automatically. It is not difficult to have several sets of images for each resolution (I can scale them myself). But when the console loads the panel.xml it would be cool if it would auto-scale the coordinates in the panel (you must do this already) and then just load the appropriate image set for that resolution (this would be a controller change I guess).</p>

<p>You mentioned you were fixing the caching of images. The only issue I noticed with the existing Android console was then the connection was lost to the controller, it would flush the image cache. This was annoying over 3G (wifi not really an issue).</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>Jack it would be good to look at the changes you made regarding image loading; in the past I have tried to improve the original image handling code because images weren't being disposed correctly (pre Android 3.0) and the way the Android console is written all images within a panel group are loaded into memory at group instantiation which is not great and this caused the majority of "out of memory errors" (particularly when using large bitmaps such as background images).</p>

<p>Scaling is a challenging problem due to the absolute sizing and positioning model currently used in the designer; display density introduces challenges here also, would be interested in knowing what solution you have implemented.</p>

<p>It would be good to incorporate your changes back into the codebase for everyone to benefit (please email me richard[at]openremote[dot]org to discuss).</p>

I am using Rich's 2.1.0 release and it is certainly  better that the stock version (in particular screen resolution is cleaner). However I find it regularly drops out and restarting sometimes takes you to the panels other times it just takes you to the Openremote controller login page.  I would be happy to help with testing if this is of use.  It would be great if there was some form of device error logging so we can put this into jira. <br/>
Let me know if I can be of assistance.<br/>

I understand the user can just drop out of the application using their home key, but if most people "back" out of an application, would it be possible to bring back this functionality to load into the last used panel?</p>

<p>As we can already bring up the settings/controller list using the android menu button (or via a gesture if the panel is setup to), can the app be set to open into the last used panel (like the ios version does)? Would anybody WANT the app to always load into the Controller List? I would have thought that most people will have a single controller on any device.</p></font>
