				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm currently a windows user and have NO knowledge of Linux.<br/>
I have installed OpenRemote onto one of my windows PC's for a play (looks great) and I'm looking to get some hardware to control and monitor.</p>

<p>I am looking to buy a Synology box ie a DS213+ or a DS413+ and do a permanent install onto this.<br/>
The questions are -<br/>
1. Until I buy the Synology unit. Can I continue my work on the OR install on the PC and then move this over to the Synology unit?</p>

<p>2. If I was to get the DS213+ box, it has two drive bays and say I set it for Raid1. Where does the operating system sit? On these drives?</p>

<p>3. When I install OpenRemote onto a Synology box, does it now sit on the Raid1 drives.</p>

<p>4. Any good things OR bad things with installing OpenRemote onto a Synology box, ie loss or gain of functionality, unable to talk to certain hardware, etc?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Neil.</p>

	<li>Yes you can work on PC and move later to Synology. That is exaclty what I did.</li>
	<li>A guy from the Synology community  maintains an <a href="http://pcloadletter.co.uk/2011/10/25/openremote-package-for-synology/">installation package for a number of boxes</a>. On his forum is a user who confirms it runs fine on DS213+</li>
	<li>The Synology OS sits on the drives you installed. Openremote is installed in a separate directory on these drives.</li>
	<li>You do not literaly have to <b>move</b> your installation from PC to Synobox. Both can start with clean installs. You make your design in a cloud service. When you are finished you just update your PC and/or Synobox from there.</li>
	<li>I am not aware of any shortcomings of the Synobox, but as OR is open, and supports may protocols, I can not tell for sure.</li>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>There are some minor installation differences depending on the CPU architecture of your Synology device. The x86 architectures are by far the easiest in terms of software installation as usually everything that worked on a standard PC (x86) hardware will work the same.</p>

<p>The ARM based Synology devices are fairly common though &#8211; these do require extra installation steps for a) the ARM based JVM from Oracle b) RXTX serial port library compiled for ARM architectures if you need access to serial port. </p>

<p>Other parts of the system should be cross-platform as long as you have the correct JVM installed.</p>

<p>For example, on ARM based Synology with Z-wave, you can check the documentation written by Joe Miller: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Synology+with+Z-Wave" title="OpenRemote 2.0 How To - Synology with Z-Wave">OpenRemote 2.0 How To &#45; Synology with Z&#45;Wave</a></p></font>
