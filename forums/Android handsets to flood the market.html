<p>It's not a dedicated mountable wall-panel thing yet, but the screen size is larger at 5 inches which makes it an interesting panel for home (at less than your usual HA-vendor $5000 price tag I would hope). So the form factor is getting in that direction. </p>

<p>Not sure how much the 3G brings in this case but for more generic uses it makes sense.</p></font>

It has the qwerty keyboard so I might finally be able to move away from the crackberry (the iphone lacking this basically ruled it out for me, I've tried typing on them and they just slow me down too much).</p>

<p>My phone basically never leaves my side, so although the wall panels do look cool, I'm more interested in having a control that I always have anyway (and I can call when I loose it down the back of the couch). From a home automation only standpoint the wall panels make sense, but from a "everything" integrated approach having to walk to the wall just seems like way to much effort <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> That, and I like cheap, and one control is cheaper than 6 (or more for bigger houses).</p>

<p>All I have to do now is wait until the droid is available in Canada, I'll let you know, probably around 2017...</p></font>

<p>I like the size of the Dell device for around the home (not wall mounted). As a phone I don't think I'd like it. I have the Nokia 770 and it's not bad, just a little too small (800x400 I think, hard on the eys). While the intention of the 'around the home' device (ie the wireless remote) is not to sit down and read a book there will be times when information needs to be presented. Which reminds me of reading the NY Times vs the BBC on the iPod. The Times reformats the information to be presented to the iPod and it's easy to read. The BBC information is just the normal web page and is really small. While I know I can expand the display the problem is that the interesting information is in the middle of the page. This means to read it it's more work to size the information and recenter. After a while it gets a little annoying.</p>

<p>BTW, has anyone played with Android on a touch device? Is it as smooth as the iPhone interface or it just a little off like a Microsoft imitation of Apple products?</p></font>

<p>The software is good enough. The hardware so far has not been up to par (but it's early). Runtime initially has been slower although now offers direct native layer and the processors are getting beefed up.</p>

<p>For a HA "press-a-button" scenario I don't think there's a difference. The little extra is you can put widgets directly into the "home screen" so you don't necessarily need to start an app to see a notification or status symbol about an event on the house. It could show up directly on the "desktop" (or whatever that is called).</p>

Verizon is pushing Droid (that's what the advert says) and it sounds like it's being sold to the techs not the average user. Why would my wife care or even know what background tasking is (or something like that)? She just wants it to work and be easy to use. The technical stuff is for folks like us.  Also the store is the biggest plus that Apple has over everyone else (it can also be it's weakeness). Right now I'm just waiting for the exodata flood. I wonder if the other carriers have learned from AT&amp;T's mistakes and will also underestimate the capacity required for all this data.</p></font>
