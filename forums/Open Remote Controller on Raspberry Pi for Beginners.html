				    <p>My Raspberry Pi arrived a couple of days ago and I have been spending some time getting to know it. I took notes as I did the install, and I thought that I would share them and hopefully save someone else a few headaches.</p>

<p>1) We should get this up as a full howto documentation on the wiki. I'll set up the page, let me know if you'd be interested in writing it.</p>

<p>2) If there are performance issues, another option is Oracle's Embedded Java SE for ARM. It does have excellent performance but unfortunately is not Open Source so usually must be downloaded separately from Oracle's website. Cacao's speed isn't the best but may well be sufficient at least for non-resource intensive installations.</p>

<p>How fortuitous. My challenge today was exactly the same. My Pi arrived on Thursday and I've been itching to get it up and running - today was going to be the day. You may have saved me heaps of time.</p>

<p>However - i'm stumbling at the start i'm afraid... when I do the JVM install using "sudo apt-get install icedtea-7-jre-cacoa", I get an error: "E: Unable to locate package icedtea-7-jre-cacoa".</p>

<p>I've tried to update the package lists by doing a "sudo apt-get update", which updates the lists ok, but afterwards I still get an Unable to locate package error.</p>

<p>any ideas?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance</p></font>

I was following you a bit too literally. I think you have a typo in your instructions.... you meant "cacao", not "cacoa".....</p>

<p>It seems to be downloading now.</p>

<p>sorry - but maybe I've saved someone else the same "doh" moment.</p>

2. Another user reported success with the Oracle Embedded Java SE for embeddded. Oracle has only released a soft-float version of its software, so you would need to download the soft-float version of raspbian from the rPi website.</p>

<p>I've started a page with some additional formatting: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Install+Controller+on+Raspberry+Pi" title="OpenRemote 2.0 How To - Install Controller on Raspberry Pi">OpenRemote 2.0 How To &#45; Install Controller on Raspberry Pi</a></p>

<p>Feel free to add any additional detail that you think would help people follow the steps you've outlined, or if you see anything missing. </p>

<p>If there's anything additional you need for formatting, screenshots etc. have a look at the page source (the formatting macros are between { } curlies). You can also look at other page source for examples, here is the formatting for Lutron page for instance: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpagesrc.action?pageId=15532901">http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpagesrc.action?pageId=15532901</a></p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi All</p>

<p>Ok - now I have hit a snag.</p>

<p>I have OR Controller running perfectly fine on my Desktop PC and using a range of devices including iPhone, Custom Android Tablet 1 and Custom Android Tablet 2 (one is 10", one is 7").</p>

<p>After last week's glory at getting OR up and running on Raspberry pi, I have since had a lot of trouble when actually using the controller with my existing panel designs. (Last week I simply created a simple dummy panel).</p>

<p>After a lot of playing today I think I can reveal that the pi seems to run seriously out of grunt when using designer panel files with "lots of stuff" in them.</p>

<p>What I mean is, if I using my Desktop as a Controller, on my devices I can see all my panels, I select the right layout for the device and everything is great.<br/>
If I use my pi as a controller, on my devices I keep getting "Cannot find Panel Identity List" error in settings and you cannot select your panel.</p>

<p>If I create a new Designer account and have a really simple panel with one layout and one button, then it works great. If I use my old designer account with lots of panels then I get the problem and pi cannot find the panel list.</p>

<p>so I assume something is either running out of grunt, or a timeout is overrunning or something.</p>

<p>In a desperate bid, I uninstalled Java Cacao and installed Oracle instead. Same result.</p>

<p>So - two questions: does anyone know how to fix this? and secondly - if it cannot be fixed (assuming it is a grunt thing), then how can I copy some of my layouts from one designer account to a new one so that I can slim them down. (No, I can't use Public Templates because you lose all of the commands when you do that <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> )</p>

<p>Looking forward to other peoples experiences or views here....</p>

<p>thanks</p></font>

<p>can you provide some background how complex your panels are e.g. how many commands you are using? I am currently also "playing around" with the Raspberry Pi but only used simple design panels with a couple of buttons. Would like to extend this to help on the analysis of the issue you are seeing. </p>

<p>Also did you had a chance to run the Raspberry Pi with the new Turbo mode? (of course this will not help if it is an memory issue)</p>

<p>Regards</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Kingrody</p>

<p>In have another post running in the esign forum on this, and posted last night that I stripped my designer files right back to one panel and then added them back in one by one until the problem occurred. The results suggest that once I got to 1.6M of designer files I got the fatal error.<br/>
I am not using any commands yet because I lost all those when. I created a new account to mess about with the pi. So my designer files are just panels. I get to about six panels before I get to 1.6M and then it fails to load on the pi. At this point the pi still claims to have 42m free memory (using free -m).</p>

<p>If you want to take a look at my panels, they are all in public templates. Search for 'HTPC', 'PC', 'SQUEEZE', 'KITCHEN', and LOUNGE and pick up everything called 'tabtronics'. I only need to load about six of these to kill it .</p>

<p>Sadly I have not yet tried Turbo mode - though i have heard of it. I need to get my head around it first.</p>

<p>I be grateful for any help..... thanks.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Martyn,</p>

<p>I had a chance to test this today with your templates. Setup of RaspberryPi:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>2012-09-18-wheezy-raspbian image</li>
	<li>icedtea-6-jre-cacao version</li>
	<li>overclock set to preset modest (800Mhz) with raspi-config</li>
</ul>


<p>I created a new panel with 6 pages (based on your templates) and was able to load the panel on the device without error (I tested ipad1,ipad2 and iPhone (of course resolution did not fit on the phone but the panel was loaded)) I did NOT face the "Cannot find Panel Identity List" error reported by you.</p>

<p>regarding the memory:<br/>
free -m shows total 184, free 140<br/>
after running openremote.sh plus panel with 6 pages:<br/>
total 184, free 78</p>

<p>As it works so well with 6 pages I tried a panel with 8 pages, a mix of your templates and some other I found. Again I could select the panel in the client settings without any error, but when the panel got loaded I received a bunch of "request timed out" errors when the device tried to load several png's from the controller e.g. "(0)The request timed out. <a href="http://192.xxx.x.xx:8080/controller/resources/Button91321271530357.png">http://192.xxx.x.xx:8080/controller/resources/Button91321271530357.png</a>"</p>

<p>As a result all pages are visible but on almost every page a few buttons were missing. </p>

<p>I increased the clock speed to 950MHz but this did not change the behavior, still getting "request timed out" errors for some of the png. I did not count them but I would say roughly 30-40% of the buttons are missing. </p>

<p>I do not know if the timed out settings on the client side can be changed, this might be an option as an workaround. On the other side we need to understand why the Pi is responding so slow to the request. </p>

<p>I hope to have some time to dig further into this in the next days, but maybe someone else has some good ideas how to get this "fixed"</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Kingrody.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for the above.<br/>
I too have had another "play", taking into consideration your information above.</p>

<p>I loaded my panels onto an iPhone - and I (like you), got the timeouts related to downloading of images. BUT - if you repeatedly go into settings and back out then (eventually) all of the button images will get downloaded (eventually). Once they are cached on the iPhone it all seems ok.</p>

<p>But.. my problem of "Cannot Get Panel List" is on my Android Tablet(s).... I wonder... is a non-fatal error of timeout on image download on an iPhone the same as a fatal error of cannot get panel identity list on an Android? Is it the same problem, but handled differently between the Android and the iOS ? I wonder?</p>

<p>The only other differences between your setup and mine (AFAIK) is that I am using Oracle JVM now (not Iced-Tea) (changed the other week to try to rid myself of the issue), and the fact that i'm not (yet) using Turbo.</p>

<p>Thanks my friend....</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>It seems slider widgets in panels don't show the current status properly with icedtea-7-jre-cacao, but with icedtea-6-jre-cacao they worked alright</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Step 10 in the instructions leads to errors when you try to sync from online designer if everything is in one line. Instead split to two commands:</li>
</ul>


<p>cd /home/pi/Desktop/OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.0/bin<br/>
./openremote.sh start</p>

<p>and this will fix the error (there appear to be some path assumptions in Openremote that fail if the process is not started in its own folder)</p>

<p>A big thanks to the Openremote team from my part!<br/>
The apartment is now set up so Raspberry Pi / Openremote is used to control light dimming via KNX and an AV-amplifier via telnet commands.
