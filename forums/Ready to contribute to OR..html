				    <p>Hi,</p>


<p>I'm a java developer/consultant working on enterprise applications for large companies<br/>
in Belgium. My professional experience mainly consists of custom software development<br/>
for some large companies in Belgium (banking, public sector, automotive...). Projects<br/>
included web applications, J2EE apps ,an MQ JMS framework,..<br/>
I don't have any professional experience with home automation: just personal interest.<br/>
The electrical system for my house is done using KNX components (mainly for lights).<br/>
I've done most of the installation and programming myself, so I have some hands on<br/>
experience. My current system is quite straightforward, so mainly just standard push<br/>
buttons. I did already do some investigations to extend my system (to use a fancy<br/>
touch screen panel or web based remote control). Unfortunately the existing open<br/>
source solutions that exist for KNX don't seem very active nor complete (Calimero,<br/>
KNXatHome, other TU Wien stuff).<br/>
Some time ago I discovered the openremote project and it does seem to be matching<br/>
the things I want to accomplish and it's compatible with my current hard&#45; and<br/>
software. (KNX components, ubuntu home server)&nbsp; It even gives me a good excuse to buy<br/>
an iPod touch.<br/>
The progress the last few months on openremote is also quite impressive, and I can't<br/>
wait to try some stuff out myself.<br/>
So if you can use my help, I will be happy to contribute, either by writing code or<br/>
testing on my home installation.</p>

<p>I haven't had a chance to try Calimero yet (still waiting for my KNX kit), but would be curious to hear the good and bad.</p>

<p>We are thinking about using it for the very simple 1.0 implementation to send out commands from ORB.</p>

<p>Alternatively work on putting a new stack together based on the KNX IP protocol we are documenting <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/knowledge/KNX+IP+Protocol" title="KNX IP Protocol">here</a> (sorry about the lack of formatting towards the end of the page, still working on it). Jorg already has a stack in Objective-C (he wiresharked it). Let us know if there's something there we can collaborate on.</p>
