				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm new to OpenRemote. When I installed my controller, I thought XPL protocol was supported, but it's not. I only found some posts about it, but these posts are rather old.</p>

<p>What's the current development status for XPL interface ? </p>

<p>I think this is very important. XPL is more than just a specific protocol, as there are dozens of them. XPL is a common framework that can be used to tie together lots of different protocols. It is a good idea to allow any hardware/software from any manufacturer to talk with eachover, without the need for every developer to support all of the existing protocols. Then, OpenRemote could rely on XPL, and any interface with equipment "X" could be obtained easily with the appropriate XPL-to-X gateway.</p>

<p>There are far too much different protocols on the market, and I don't know what hardware or what new protocol I'll be using tomorrow. I don't want to build, or buy, a system without being sure I'll be able to upgrade it the way I want in the future. That's the reason why I'm building my home setup around this idea, using XPL as the main protocol for my core controller.</p>

<p>Then, I think implementing XPL into OpenRemote would be a great benefit in terms if interoperability. Lots of XPL gateways are already available. And you could focus on the development of the engine (ie, the GUI) without having to reinvent the wheels (ie, implementing more and more different protocols)</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
