<p>Good things come with a minimum of two and we are getting plenty of attention in the blogosphere this week, ignited by Matt Asay's blog on OpenRemote, no doubt.</p>

<p>This time it's the register in the UK:
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/15/openremore_prototype/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/15/openremore_prototype/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A glance at the X10 website, which is chock-full of bodacious babes hawking cameras, security systems, lighting controllers and more, may not inspire confidence in the maturity of the home automation community. However, the OpenRemote folks really are serious developers - as might be evidenced by Fleury's experience with the JBoss Community.</p></blockquote>

<p>We hope OpenRemote can introduce some sense of confidence about HA technology in general. There's more to HA than spying on the boobage of the bodacious neighbour next door. </p>
