				    <p>What i would really like to see in 2.0, except for the more KNX commands that are already planned for, is some extra security. Like a 4-digit passcode before logon, in combination with a MAC-filter for instance.</p>

<p>The reason for this is, as knx is getting spread wider and wider, it also starts involving serious security devices. Jung for instance has now a burglar alarm system that can be operated through KNX. It would be awesome if you'd be able to include that in your macro's, so you could leave your house and, with one press of a button on your iphone, turn down the shades, the lights, the heating, and turn on the alarm sytem.</p>

<p>That, on the other hand, requires an additional level of security. Proctecting the Wifi with WPA is one thing, but that would prevent (friendly) guests from using the network as well. So a passcode on the iphone app would come in very handy.</p>

<p>I have some other wishes, but it might very well be that these are already implemented in 2.0. So before taking the risk of asking that which is already thee, I eagerly await what is coming <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Is there a featurelist for 2.0 available? That would save me the time of coming up with wanted features that are already being implemented<img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/biggrin.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>
