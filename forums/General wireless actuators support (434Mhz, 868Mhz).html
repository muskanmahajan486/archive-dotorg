				    <p>All,</p>

<p>there exist a lot of cheap wireless actuators based on 434Mhz and 868Mhz frequenzies. Especially in Germany you can get sets of 3 outlets or dimmers for less then 20â‚¬. Some community members pointed out some gateways to control those devices and I want to start this thread to collect some information.</p>

<p>I personally played around already with the ezcontrol T-10 (<a href="http://www.ezcontrol.de/content/view/30/56/">http://www.ezcontrol.de/content/view/30/56/</a>). This device is not for sale anymore but some people might still have one. The company created a new version which is the XS1 (<a href="http://www.ezcontrol.de/content/view/36/28/">http://www.ezcontrol.de/content/view/36/28/</a>). Those devices support a wide range of protocols based on the mentioned frequencies and can control almost anything which is out there. Since they support HTTP, I was able to control my outlets with OpenRemote and the included HTTP protocol. The new model also support wireless weather stations and sensors. If somebody has the XS1 it would be nicht to hear more about it.</p>

<p>Another similar device might be the tellstickDuo which was mentioned in this thread (<a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/tellstickDuo">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/tellstickDuo</a>). From reading the website (<a href="http://www.telldus.se/products/range">http://www.telldus.se/products/range</a>) it looks like the tellstickDuo is only supported by the cloud software which the company is hosting and you need an account. But the new model (<a href="http://www.telldus.se/products/tellstick_net">http://www.telldus.se/products/tellstick_net</a>) seems to support direct TCP/IP control. Anybody who has this device is welcome to give some more information about it.</p>

<p>The third solution for 434Mhz device is the busware.de hardware (<a href="http://busware.de/tiki-index.php">http://busware.de/tiki-index.php</a>). They also support the mentioned wireless frequencies and you can get a opensource firmware for this hardware (<a href="http://culfw.de/culfw.html">http://culfw.de/culfw.html</a>). The CUN firmware for TCP/IP supports telnet and has an open protocol. It should already be possible to control something using the OpenRemote telnet protocol.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I've been a user of FS20 related devices for a few years now and after doing a lot of research these are my findings.</p>

<p>Busware has created a device family called CUL (434 &amp; 868) with houses the CUL branch (USB connected) and CUN branch (ethernet connected). <br/>
The devices have firmware support written by Rudolf K"oenig  called the "culfw". This firmware supports an enormous bunch of hardware which uses the slowRF (AM) and FastRF (FM) modulation band and was originally written for HA software called FHEM(.de)</p>

<p>culfw supports following RF protocols:</p>

<p>    "SlowRF" mode (1kHz datarate, AM)<br/>
        FS20: send/receive<br/>
        There are numerous FS20 devices, AFAIK. all of them are fully supported.<br/>
        FHT: send/receive<br/>
        Communication to the FHT80b and directly to the FHT8v is supported.<br/>
        S300: receive<br/>
        Examples of such devices: S300TH, KS300-2<br/>
        EM1000: receive<br/>
        Devices: EM1000FM, EM1000GZ, EM1000WZ<br/>
        HMS: receive<br/>
        Devices: There are numerous HMS devices, AFAIK. all of them are fully supported.<br/>
        Hoermann: receive<br/>
        Some 868 Hoermann garage door openers.<br/>
        ESA2000: send and receive<br/>
        Lacrosse TX2/TX3: receive<br/>
        Intertechno: send</p>

<p>    BidCos(R) in the "AskSin" mode (20kHz datarate, FM). HomeMatic(R) Wireless devices use this protocol.<br/>
    EnOcean is the latest supported device range.</p>

<p>About a year ago i started to use a HA implementation called Domotiga(.nl) and the developer Ron Klinkien wanted to add support for CUL/CUN. The result is he is now doing great work by implementing all devices into domotiga which is a hell of a job.</p>

<p>I think there is a more easy way and that is how the guys of mediola did it by creating the AIO. <a href="http://www.mediola.de">http://www.mediola.de</a></p>

<p>AIO is a payd version of a product similair to OpenRemote with a kick-ass interface. I played with it and its really the best i've seen so far. (check the movies on the website)</p>

<p>These guys have written support for a gateway called the Homematic CCU central. <a href="http://www.elv.de/output/controller.aspx?cid=74&amp;detail=10&amp;detail2=25060">http://www.elv.de/output/controller.aspx?cid=74&amp;detail=10&amp;detail2=25060</a>  <br/>
This gateway was originally written only for Homematic device but a smart guy wrote a daemon called the CUx daemon <a href="http://www.homematic-inside.de/software/addons/cuxd.html">http://www.homematic-inside.de/software/addons/cuxd.html</a> which integrates the CUL/CUN devices so that they are presented as in the CCU. With this is place the road is open for integrating all 434 and 868 devices on the planet. </p>

<p>My idea to the OR team is to write support for the Homematic CCU so that you have a uniorme/integral way of access and no decoding of messages strings needs to be done.</p>

<p>The support base of culfw is expanding rapidly and a interface like OR is what everybody (in the this RF scene) is waiting for.</p>

<p>I'm not a java programmer so i cant do it myself but i know for sure this combination a rough diamond witing to be shaped.</p>

<p>A great entry to the world of RF.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>What would be needed to support this in OpenRemote? <br/>
We need to control the CCU (which is also able to control anything connected via CUL/CUN)?<br/>
How is the CCU controlled? Is there a TCP based protocol?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The CCU is TCP based with an (partially) opensource firmware which can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.homematic.com">http://www.homematic.com</a> website.</p>

<p>The SDK is available here <a href="http://www.homematic.com/index.php?id=151&amp;L=1">http://www.homematic.com/index.php?id=151&amp;L=1</a></p>

<p>At the moment CUXd only supports 868 SlowRF devices but as i understood the 434 version of CUL will be supported soon. </p>

<p>Since i dont own a CCU yet i cant tell for sure but that will change soon.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I also use the ezcontrol T10 and a old R10 for receiving Temp Sensor information. </p>

<p>So the new xs1 doesn't support udp anymore, but there is a json api to control the devices. </p>

<p>I connect to the devices via php and udp. So you can call for the status of the actors (not possible via buildin http). </p>

<p>The R10 is only reachable via udp to get the sensorinformation of of 433 MHZ sensors (i.e. Temp, Remotecontrol, etc). R10 has alos a small scripting engine and a timer, so it is possible to control actors in dependence of the sensorinformation and time (should be possible in OR for the future <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> )</p>

<p>Especially the Intertechno actors are working very well with ezcontrol. </p>

<p>There is also a cheap variant of a FS20 IR Transmitter (www.elv.de). so you can control IR devices via ezcontrol.</p>

<p>If you have questions, send me a short information.</p></font>
