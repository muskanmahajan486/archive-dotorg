				    <p>I'm quite new to OpenRemote but had the possibility to play with it some time ago, and even made it work with some HTTP-based sensors, when there was no way to set intervals or regex expressions. Well, this time I've defined some sensors attached to a few HTTP commands. I've also set different polling intervals (1s, 10s, 30s) and checked that my device was being polled at the configured intervals. My device is returning plain text, to be displayed on the panel "per se", so there is no need to parse it in any way.</p>

<p>The problem is that my panel is not being updated with real values. All sensors show "N/A" so I guess I'm making a noob mistake. I've tested this from my Android phone and from Webconsole.</p>

<p>There is obviously something between controller and remotes that prevent the values from being updated but I can's find where the problem is. I've also searched the forums but was unable to find similar posts... Have I to configure the controller application in some way? (apart from loading the panels, of course).</p>

<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

<p>Daniel.</p>

<p>That made the difference. I was using level sensors instead.</p>

<p>Thanks again Marcus!!</p></font>
