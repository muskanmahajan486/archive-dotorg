				    <p>Hy to all of openremote team.<br/>
Frankly speaking, I'm really impress by the job done on this tool for home control. I'm currently working on KNX equipment at home and half of the house is done. <br/>
I'm trying to understand the behavior of openremote controller and I'm not sure to understand very well. <br/>
I'd like to develop an interface for iphone, ipad and also for android (Archos 8) with designer tool. My first question is how could I adapt designer to the size of my android tablet ? <br/>
I tried custom panel but it has not worked at all.</p>

<p>After, I'm also a bit lost with the command, sensor, switch and all these topics. I tried to look at the documentation to better understand but I dont see exactly what are the functions of each of these items. </p>

<p>Sorry for these questions from a new comer</p>

<p>Regards<br/>
Thierry</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Thierry,</p>

<p>The Android panel screen size is a bit tricky at the moment &#8211; since we are using API 3 the different screen sizes must be specified explicitly in the configuration which is not working too well with custom panel sizes.</p>

<p>This will be a trivial fix when upgrading to a later Android API's (in fact Eric Bariaux already fixed this I believe) although I still need to look into the details.</p>

<p>So at the moment, the current Android client version is more or less a fixed resolution. I'll look at it once I get back to making changes to the Android client.</p>

<p>&#8211; Juha</p>

You can check the video tutorial, maybe that helps:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/openremote#p/a/u/2/qQrUUCvQASQ">http://www.youtube.com/openremote#p/a/u/2/qQrUUCvQASQ</a></p>

<p>We will need to work more on the Designer to simplify this though.</p>
