				    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm Rafel, from Barcelona.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do my first KNX panel, but something crash.</p>

<p>I have:</p>

<p>+ Windows7xProfx64bits<br/>
+ Siemens N148/22</p>

<p>I bought the Siemens N148/22 since in theory support up to 5 connections simultaneous, but I think the PO does not support N148/22.</p>

<p>I was doing a rather simple test to turn on (switch on / off) for 6 hours without success. Finally the work, I decided to change the N148/22, for a N148/21 that my friend lent me and with this rather simple change, the system was able turning the light-</p>

<p>I think the N148/22 is interesting because you can have 5 commented simultaneous connections, which allows viewing on the ETS circulating telegrams from the bus, while other products can also connect to the bus.</p>

<p>Greetings.</p>

<p>The error was:<br/>
ERROR HTTP\-Threat\-2 org.openremote.controler.protocol.knx.KNXConectionManager$CalimeroConnection.sendInternal&lt;1151&gt; | Unable to send KNX commandFRAME L_Data.req 0.0.0 -&gt; 0/0/30 Data: 0x01. Connection closed.<br/>
.......</p>

<p>I have a printscreen, but I don't know how to clip in this forum.</p>

<p>Greetings.<br/>
Rmayol</p>

<p>The error shown says connection is closed... I still need to put connection retry policy in place when this happens, but this would have been easily solved with a controller restart. Unless the /22 would for some reason be very aggressive in closing connections.</p>

<p>You can attach screenshots with the insert image button on the top but better is if you can go to your Controller/logs/controller.log file and post here the parts related to KNX.</p>
