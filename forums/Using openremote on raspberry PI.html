				    <p>For a while I've been toying around with my raspberry pi + razberry z-wave module, and I was able to get everything working together with openremote, following the instructions here: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Z-Wave+with+Razberry">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Z-Wave+with+Razberry</a>, but now that I've re-installed my raspberry, I'm running into trouble.</p>

<p>Since the official razberry forum seems to be dead (can't post anything there anymore, forum is full of spam and complaining users), I hope someone here can help me out (before I toss it out of the window and buy a proper z-wave controller <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> )</p>

<p>First of all, I had to do install z-way server 1.3.1, because 1.4.1. just wont start (see <a href="http://en.z-wave.me/content/z-way-server-v141-inst-working-v131-works-solved">http://en.z-wave.me/content/z-way-server-v141-inst-working-v131-works-solved</a>)<br/>
After I got that working, I wanted to install RaZ-OR, but for that I would have to modify /opt/z-way-server/automation/config.json , but there's nu such file there...<br/>
This is all I got:<br/>

<p>Manually creating it and adding openremote.js doesn't do anything either.</p>

<p>Another strange thing is that commands like <a href="http://myrpip:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices2.instances0.commandClasses0x20.Set(255">http://myrpip:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices2.instances0.commandClasses0x20.Set(255</a>) result in errors like : 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'Set' of undefined' eventhough I certainly have a device 2  (a simple on/off switch)</p>

<p>any ideas?</p>

Somewhere there is also a link to the older HowTo dealing with version 1.3.1.</p>

<p>It is very unfortunate that the forum is dead they had plans to repair, but that is low priority.<br/>
My last mails to them have remained unanswered. So, if you want to do anything more serious with OpenRemote and Z-Wave, you probably are better of choosing Micasa Verde Vera. There is a Howto for the Vera and OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Sorry that I can't do more for you at the moment.</p></font>

<p>I'm still considering the Micasa Verde Vera, I've wathced a few youtube clips about it, and it seems like getting everything up and running with it is a lot easier than with the razberry (especialy the automation part)</p></font>
