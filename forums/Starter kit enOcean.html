				    <p>I'm very fond of enOcean protocol, especially no service bit is very appealing to me. I don't have any items using this protocol yet but would start to investigate it. Therefore I need a kind of starter kit to get me going. Can somebody recommend something to me? Not too expensive and yet allowing for a good grip on the technology. All tips are welcome.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Michal,</p>

<p>I think a starter kit for testing EnOcean technology should include the following components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>USB interface</li>
	<li>Switch</li>
	<li>Sensor (temperature/humidity, window contact...)</li>
	<li>Actuator</li>
</ul>


<p>The cheapest USB interface is the 'BSC EnOcean Smart Connect USB' stick. </p>

<p>My favorite sensors are from TELEFUNKEN (Temperature/Humidity). The TELEFUNKEN devices are in conformance with the EnOcean specification, are compact in size and have a reasonable price. Unfortunately they are only available in germany but I have had good experiences with <a href="http://www.manketech-shop.de">manketech</a> when ordering. </p>

<p>Last week I've seen that <a href="http://www.berker.com">BERKER</a> has some brand new EnOcean switches. I haven't seen them in real life but I'm pretty much sure that they are by far the best EnOcean switches to date. The base module (2411 10 09 or 2412 10 09) can be combined with frames from the S.1/B.3/B.7 series!!</p>

<p>For EnOcean actuators see the following thread: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Cannot+find+EnOcean-Controller">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Cannot+find+EnOcean-Controller</a>. The RCM250 is a very compact device but it it's not a dimmer - just a ON/OFF relay. All other actuators which support the F6-02-01 EEP profile should be OK.</p>

<p>There's also a starter kit from EnOcean itself - the 'EnOcean ESK 300 starter kit'. It costs about 110 â‚¬. It contains the USB stick, a sensor and 2 switches. This kit does not contain an actuator and these devices are not intended for normal use - only for testing.</p></font>
