				    <p>Hi.  </p>

<p>Just started using OpenRemote about a month ago and I have to say...I'm very impressed.</p>

<p>I have my DSC alarm system and Envisalink 4 working with OpenRemote.  I followed the document and got all the basic things to work, very easily.  The one command that seemed to be missing was the *1 command, which arms the interior when you're in Arm-Stay mode.  </p>

<p>I read through the Envisalink TPI manual and have learned how to send commands to the Envisalink, using Netcat.  I understand how the commands are structured and how to calculate the checksum value.  I tried using Telnet and TCP/IP so send the *1 commands, but no luck.  I think it has to do with the fact that the Envisalink only allows one socket to port 4025 and OpenRemote already has that open if you are using commands with the DSCIT-100 protocol.  I was able to send the commands successfully with NetCat, once I dis-connected the controller.</p>

<p>So, I started digging and I managed to de-compile the class files (once I learned what a class file is) and I learned that all the additional commands are indeed in there.  So, I added the Keystroke command in Designer and set the IP address of the Envisalink, set the partition to 1 and instead of sending the alarm password under code, I sent *1.  Now, it actually works, however, when I send the command, I don't get the 'beep-beep' from the keypad to let me know the interior is armed, like I do if I enter *1 from the keypad or when I send the command 0711*124 using Netcat.  Instead, I get a "system is unavailable' command on the keypad, but once it clears, it does in fact change to Arm-Away mode, which is verified by my keypad and by the virtual sensor on my iPad app.</p>

<p>So finally, my question...is there a better way to send the *1 command, using the Keystroke command, ie. 071?</p>

<p>Thanks!  </p>
