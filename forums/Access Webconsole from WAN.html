				    <p>I just updated my openremote to the latest versions of both the controller and webconsole.  I can access the webconsole from any computer that is on the same network, but not from outside my lan.  I do have basic username and password enabled on my controller.  I noticed that I don't need the username and password when accessing the webconsole from the lan.  My droid and ipad work fine.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Mike</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Mike,</p>

<p>I'm not sure what version of the WebConsole you are using but I would recommend a version from my server: -</p>

<p><a href="http://multimation.co.uk:8080/controller/webconsole.war">http://multimation.co.uk:8080/controller/webconsole.war</a></p>

<p>The Web Console now includes the build revision along the bottom of the settings toolbar; a lot of enhancements have been made to the web console recently and security support being one of them.</p>

<p>Whether inside your LAN or not if you have security enabled on your controller the web console will need to login so I would double check that you have security enabled as you expect.</p>

<p>To access outside of your LAN you will need to do a couple of things: -</p>

<p>1). Open a port on your router and forward it to the PC in your LAN that is running the Tomcat server (e.g. open port 8080 TCP and forward it to 192.168.1.2:8080 - change IP Address to match your Tomcat server IP)</p>

<p>2). Unless you have a static WAN IP you will need to use a service like dyndns to give you a friendly URL to access your home remotely (something like <a href="http://miketirpak.dyndns.org">http://miketirpak.dyndns.org</a>, this is free and the key part is that your router supports dynamic IP services - within your router settings you specify the service you are using i.e. dyndns and your login credentials and whenever your WAN IP changes your router will notify dyndns so it can make sure that your URL always points to your home) If your router doesn't support dynamic IP services then you can use an app on your PC to do the updating for you.</p>

<p>There is also openremote.com (not sure if it is live yet) which offers a proxy service so you don't have to do any of the above, making life nice and simple but you have to pay a subscription. Using the commercial option means you just associate your controller with your designer account and then you just login on the console using your credentials anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>For WAN access you need to have the port forwarding configured as I described and then use the appropriate URL which would need to resolve to your WAN IP.</p>

<p>If you can't copy the URL you are using the web console into a browser and get the Controller Sync web page then it just isn't going to work.</p>

I've been meaning to dive into the development side of this, but home and work have been keeping me busy.  Hopefully I'll have some time this winter to get into it.  I'm not really a developer though, I'm more of an integrator/designer.  By trade, I'm a network admin.  I do home automation for fun.</p>

I am in the process of creating an Android version of the Web Console so it looks like a native app but is really HTML behind the scenes. Don't know if you'd be interested in testing it out, if so Watch the below page and I'll paste a link soon to the APK: -</p>

<p>I think most developers start by playing around and lots of Googling; apologies for telling you how to sort your WAN access out then if you're a network admin.</p></font>

I would be happy to test out another version of the android app.  My phone is running gingerbread though.  I have the first Droid X.  I've been meaning to get a new one, but I just can't find an android phone I can get behind.  Thinking hard about the galaxy nexus.  I know its over a year old, but its better than the phone I have now and it has a LTE radio.</p>

<p>I recently did something similar with one of my webpages.  I used appsgeyser<a href="http://www.appsgeyser.com/">http://www.appsgeyser.com/</a> to make a native android app.  Definitely not the same as phonegap.  </p>

<p>I'll keep an eye out for the apk.</p>
