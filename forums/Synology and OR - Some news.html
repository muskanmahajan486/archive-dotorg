				    <p>Information for all synology owner, a new DSM has been released in Beta 4.2<br/>
and the good surprise is that some new official packages are available.<br/>
Among those packages, there is a new "Java Manager" package to manage the java installation on your NAS.<br/>
There is also a "TOMCAT" package inluding the Tomcat Gui Manager. It's more easy to manage several "java/jsp" application running on the same application server than having each application running its own Tomcat server, like, I think its the case with the current OR Synology package.</p>

<p>Exactly what is needed to deploy the OR on the synology and keep the full flexibility of your "custom" installation.</p>

<p>If you're not aware to Java, Tomcat, ... I'll recommend you to continue with the very good and easy to install synology OR package created by patters on <a href="http://pcloadletter.co.uk/2011/10/25/openremote-package-for-synology/">http://pcloadletter.co.uk/2011/10/25/openremote-package-for-synology/</a></p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>I am fairly new at this so I hope you can help me out.<br/>
I recently installed the mentioned package, however the controller in the package is not up to date so<br/>
some of my functions in my OpenRemote setup does not work correctly.<br/>
Therefore I would like to update my controller. <br/>
Since I donÂ´t want to be depending on "patters" to update the package I hope you are able to guide me through installing<br/>
it the hard way.....??<br/>
I already have the Tomcat and Java Manager installed, but where do I go from there?</p>

<p>Does there exist a tutorial or guide on how to do this?</p>

<p>Regards</p></font>
