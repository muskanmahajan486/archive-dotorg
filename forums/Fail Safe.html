				    <p>I just setup a new controller for my dad so that he can open/close and monitor his garage door. I'm using a webcontrol board to do that. He asked me if there was away to setup a fail safe button for the garage door opener. His fear is that he is sometimes in a hurry and might accidentally hit the button then close the app before seeing if the door is open or not.</p>

<p>I think I can do it by programming the board to look for variable through PLC. Considering I have other commands already running more important tasks, I would like to keep the code as short as possible.</p>

<p>Right now I have am using a macro to send an on/off command to the board which is plugged into a relay that is wired to the physical opener. Is there a way to program openremote so that he would have to hit the button twice to actually send the command macro?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Mike</p>

I had to wire in a relay switch to the output on the board.  The board does not support momentary output commands.  So I have to use a macro to send an on command then off command otherwise the opener would just stay on. I think I can set it up with PLC on the board, but I was hoping there was a way to do it with openremote. </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>You can try and use the rules engine for this.<br/>
Create a virtual switch which triggers a rule when turned on.<br/>
That same rule would increment a counter and turn the switch off again (so it can immediatly be turned on again)<br/>
When the switch is hit again the same rule is trigered. When the counter reaches "2" execute your actual on and off for the relay and reset the counter to "0".<br/>
You will not need the macro anymore since the rule will perform the "on" and "off".</p>

<p>This is just an idea but you will have to try it out.<br/>
There some rule related posts in the forum already and the testsuite of the controller also has a few rules.</p></font>
