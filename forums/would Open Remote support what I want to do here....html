				    <p>So I basically want to:<br/>
a) in first instance extend the platform to monitor a feed of solar data &amp; trigger remote switches based on logic (see below)<br/>
b) perform it via extending an existing home automation piece of software that:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>supports for X-wave, X10 etc out of the box</li>
	<li>support monitoring over internet (browser based - i expose my webserver via port forwarding - does not have )</li>
	<li>ideally would be open-source (but otherwise highly extensible closed source)</li>
	<li>extensibility mechanism would need to have flexibility of some language support (if/then, etc)</li>
</ul>


<p>Specific initial requirement details:</p>

<p>a) Receive a feed of input data from power consumption/solar generation:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>from these devices <a href="http://www.currentcost.com/products.html">http://www.currentcost.com/products.html</a></li>
	<li>it is possible to get a feed of this data into a PC via USB cable</li>
</ul>


<p>b) Process this data: My code (where I extend the platform) would review every few minutes and make decisions re switches devices on/off</p>

<p>c) Trigger remote Power Switches (Z-wave) </p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>ad a) At first glance I would say the Netsmart device might be used for collecting energy data. But you have to see if it is fit for reading with our Http protocol.</li>
	<li>ad b) Can be done with the built-in Drools engine. Definitely if you are familiar with Java a lot can be done there.</li>
	<li>as c) There is native support for Z-Wave switches and dimmers.</li>
</ul>


<p>I done a piece of Solar production monitoring (<a href="http://www.openremote.org/x/TyVdAQ">http://www.openremote.org/x/TyVdAQ</a>)</p>

It only reports every so many minutes to the Website of the company where you bought it. So it will only be useful as long as they happen to conduct this business. I would always choose to be in control of my own primary data.<br/>
So it also seems unlikely that you can read directly from the device using the http OpenRemote control. But you can always ask the supplier if there is a backdoor....</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks Pieter - actually on the Vera forums someone pointed out a constraint for the DIY Zwave'r.  Would be interested in your comments?</p>

<p>------<br/>
You still can't use Z-Wave Locks with any of the open source Z-Wave projects.<br/>
The Secure Z-Wave protocols are locked up with NDAs and very expensive development kits.<br/>
This was a non starter for me.</p>

<p>Ad a developer, there is a huge difference in the level of abstraction at the Z-Wave protocol level (provided by Z-Wave devices) compared with what you do using Vera.<br/>
The comparison is kind of like the differences in programming for Socket vs Ajax Requests.<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I don't have a Vera, so I can't tell. I do have a RaZberry, which gives a pretty low level approach to the Zwave devices. At this moment they haven't implemented all standard command classes yet. As a result some devices are only partially supported. Their inteface does allow to determine which commands are available for a specific device. You have to do quite a bit of reading to understand. At least I had to. The RaZberry approach breaks, in case individual suppliers have made implementations that do not communicate correctly with their competitors. These incompatibilities seem to be partially due to weak specifications.<br/>
Other controller suppliers seem to take a device oriented approch, where they have the option to make a "kludge" around a deviating device. (For which the consumer has to pay...). But the RaZberry has plenty of problems too. </p>

<p>I have noticed that some companies have only part of their devices certified. As one of the key features of Z-Wave is a <em>meaningfull</em> interoperability of devices, it is a major flaw that the Z-Wave alliance does not publish a centralised open register of certified devices. </p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Z-Wave, despite of good technology, is only a minor player in five years time.</p></font>
