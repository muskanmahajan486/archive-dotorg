				    <p>I am a total noob to OpenRemote, but I love the concepts and I am considering install.</p>

<p>I have Lutron and Insteon (ISY) hybrid in my home for lighting plus XBMC for entertainment.</p>

<p>My initial immediate need is to be able to do a simple bridge from Insteon (ISY) to Lutron (and back to insteon if possible).<br/>
???  If yes, I would dive into OR with hopes for much goodness...</p>

<p>I understand (conceptually) that I can "integrate" my ISY with an OR controller AND that I can "integrate" my Homeworks Lutron with the OR Controller...</p>

<p>The question is whether I can use the OR controller to "bridge" an ISY command to a Homeworks command.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an example of how to do this (assuming it is possible)...</p>

<p>Are the links between these devices "bi-directional" for both "status" and "action"???</p>

<p>I am also planning on installing an OR Controller on my Synology NAS at some point...</p>

<p>Can I make SYNOLOGY + LUTRON + ISY + XMBC magic happen???</p>

<p>I would be willing to subsidize open source development as needed!</p>

<p>Thanks a million in advance!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Don't think there are instructions for that particular combination yet.</p>

<p>For bridging, depends how you are defining it. If for example your use case is such that there's a single scene in which both the lutron and ISY participate in, then yes that's quite doable. Other type of "bridge" could be that a lighting switch is turned on which results in a notification on the lutron system which is detected by OR and causes a command action on ISY network.</p>

<p>These are typically "scenarios" in automation systems, somewhat higher level in logic than simply a "bridge" which in network terms is a lower level packet transportation between networks.</p>

<p>HTH</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>First step would be to have your OR controller talk to both systems.</p>

<p>For simple scenarios, you can use a macro that includes command to both systems. A button linked to that macro will then trigger that scene in a transparent way.</p>

<p>For more advanced 2-way interaction, you'll need to use rules.<br/>
For instance, <a href="http://openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Translate+1-Wire+to+KNX">here</a> is some example of translating from 1-wire to KNX. You would probably have to do something along the same lines.</p>

<p>Also note at this stage, that the Lutron protocol gives feedback on the selected scene on a GrafikEye, the value of a dimmer level and the status of keypad LEDs. It will not notify Open Remote when a key on a Lutron keypad is pressed.</p>

<p>As I've done the original Lutron implementation, if this is something you need, let me know and I'll take a quick look to point you (or anybody who wants to contribute on that one) in the right direction on how to add that (or have a look at implementing myself if I have time and nobody steps up for it).</p></font>
