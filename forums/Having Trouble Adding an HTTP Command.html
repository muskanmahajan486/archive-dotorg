				    <p>Hello, I'm new to OR but loving the concepts and ability to customize it!  </p>

<p>I've watched several videos and read the documentation but I'm having trouble executing a simple HTTP command.  I've added a device, then added a command, told the Designer that it's an HTTP command, added a button to my screen that references that command but no joy.  I can enter the URL in my web browser and there are no issues, so I'm sure I'm just not understanding how to make this work in OR.</p>

<p>Basically, I have an Indigo server that accepts URL's to do pretty much anything.  Entering <a href="http://10.1.200.2:8176/devices/Craigs%20Office%20Torchiere%20Lamp?isOn=1&amp;_method=put">http://10.1.200.2:8176/devices/Craigs%20Office%20Torchiere%20Lamp?isOn=1&amp;_method=put</a> into the browser works fine, but putting that same command into the URL portion of my HTTP command doesn't do anything at all.  I hoped that maybe the console window where I ran the controller command (I'm using Mac) would show something but it doesn't.</p>

<p>I have changed the command to be PUT, POST and GET, none of them seem to do the trick.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me some direction on this? </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Or...Can you change the %20 to spaces in the URL portion of the HTTP POST command?</p>

<p>I'm not sure that's the fix but it's caused me issues in the past.</p></font>
