				    <p>Hi Folks,</p>

<p>First of all, OpenRemote is great, thank for that to all of you!</p>

<p>I try to control video playback computers via TCP/IP commands with OpenRemote. I would like to have a command, like Take, wich means play the selected movie, but I want it to be syncronized, so I want to send the command to all of the computers in the same time. Plus I want this program to be universal so it can handle one computer or ten.</p>

<p>My problem is that in the designer I can make the command with one IP address, port, and command line, and it is works well but how can I put more IP address or a range of IP addresses to this command? Is it possible? Or is there any other solution for this?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help guys!</p>

<p>cheers,</p>

<p>Andras</p>

<p>However, it does require that you create a command for each IP address so depending how large the range of IP addresses is, this may or may not be feasible.</p>

<p>Other solutions will be a little more involved, maybe requiring some programming skills.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks Juha! </p>

<p>Macro is maybe not an elegant solution but it will works for me, because I have not more than 10 machines with manual IP's so make 10 commands is not a big deal. </p>

<p>One more thing, the commands will fire at once, or it will fire in the order inside of the macro so should I count some minor delay?</p>

<p>Big help for me, thanks again!</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Should be in order defined in the macro. So there's likely a small delay. You can define additional delays yourself if necessary. I can't recall if there's a 'default' delay between macro commands, I think there shouldn't be but let us know how it works for you.</p>
