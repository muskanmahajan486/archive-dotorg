				    <p>Hi I've bought an Ebox for my OR implementation which I hope will be a bit more performant than the Raspberry Pi.  I am having a lot of trouble getting a clean Ubuntu Linux installed with their drivers.  I am using an SD card and followed the rather dated instructions I can find on the web.   Has anyone got this working with OR using just an SD card and if so how did you do it?   In fact ideally if I can get hold of a working OR/Linux image then I would be very happy!!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>After a week or two of pain I can report that the Ebox is a pretty good platform for OR.  I ended up installing Windows XP which meant buying an external CD/DVD off ebay as well as a 3.5inch sata hd.  <br/>
The ebox seems to be much faster that the Raspberry Pi I replaced.  The only issue was finding a version of Java but I found a release 1.6 U22 which is fine.  </p>
