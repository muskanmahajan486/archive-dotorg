				    <p>I'm fairly new to this but so far love what I've found. I tried searching the forums but did not find the answer to this question/issue. With that said....</p>

<p>This may or may not be an issue but I'm curious about it... If I place an image on the screen (Ipad Layout) and then try to place a grid widget over the image, it ends up behind the image and you can't access it anymore. The only way to get to the gird is to move the original image. Is this expected behavior or am I doing something wrong? Buttons lay on top of the image just fine but I can't see the grid once it is placed on the screen. This makes it very hard to configure it. Perhaps this is the way it's suppose to work?</p>


<p>Is this a Java version issue? (I have tried in different browsers (Chrome and Firefox) with the same results. Or by design? Or is something else going wrong.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help/info you can give me.</p>
