				    <p>I've been trying out open remote and trying to get it working with some devices controlled by Telnet and some controlled by a GC-100.  Currently when entering telnet &amp; IR commands it is a bit cumbersome.  Each command requires entering IP address/port and for the GC-100 it requires I manually create the IR command which means if I ever swap it out for another device I will have to rewrite all the commands.</p>

<p>Are there any plans to add something I'll call a protocol adapter which can be tied to a device or globally?  This could identify the IP address and device type of the command receiver, along with any defaults.  Then for adding a command you can just tie the command to the protocol adapter and use the default values for most things.  This would also enable easy implementation of a connection manager as the connections are tied to a single "protocol adapter".  In the case of the GC-100 it would be possible to have this be an IR protocol adapter and then each command could be implemented in pronto hex and automatically converted to the right command language to have them sent to the GC-100 (I already have some Java code to do this conversion).</p>

<p>This was an idea I had, I'd like to try and play around with an implementation in the coming months when I get some spare time but wanted to throw the idea out there to see if anyone was looking into something like this.</p>

<p>If this is something you'd like to work on, let's re-open the discussion and see how to add that to OR.</p>

<p>For the specific IR case, what you describe would indeed be the desirable "final" solution.<br/>
For now, there is a wizard in the Professional Designer that allows to upload a Pronto XCF configuration file and generate the required TCP commands for GC or UDP commands for IRTrans. So the conversion code it's there, but applied at design time and not at runtime as would be most flexible.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Mike, I absolutely agree with you. Saying that "OR supports IR sending through GC or IrTrans" (having the user to enter sendir,4:1,0,39857,1,1,96,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,984) is to me akin to saying that a ball-pen "supports" the Chinese language... </p>

<p>I did a serious attempt <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/A+better+IR-Command">here</a> but the response was "not overwhelming".</p></font>
