				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Just found out the existence of this great project.</p>

<p>As I understand your primary focus is to use existing HW. My question to the users reading this forum: is anyone working on a open HW panel, or does anybody know a group working on such a thing?<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>As I'm an embedded SW engineer, GUI is not my thing, but if this group needs some HW to support other protocols then give a yell.</p>

<p>My current interest is in Zigbee and various 433MHz based systems (e.g. the dutch brand KlikAanKlikUit), now having some I2C driven co-processor boards for KlikAanKlikUit (this one is rebranded with different names) and SPI driven Zigbee co-processor (EM/ST-260 based).<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Wkr,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Joep</p>

<p>While not an official answer, here's my opinion: it's a little hard to say what we are and what we're not except to say we are a community of people interested in smart homes and its technology. We want to reuse hardware where possible but we're not against building out own or getting someone to do it for us (like the touch screens). We have installers who probably won't want to use the one off custom hardware, users who can't touch high end systems and everyone in between.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a lot of KNX, I can't get that systems here in the States. So I'll be working on Insteon (I don't think this is available outside the Americas yet). There is also various software support for IP, RS232 and USB communications. There's a recent message from Akiba (<a href="http://www.freaklabs.org/">Freaklabs</a>) on building ZigBee and another on IPV6, ZigBee and LoPAN. All of these are appropriate to the project. Currently I think there are more software people than hardware people.</p></font>

<p>At the moment I have a nice Asus EEE 1005HA, the mouse pad support multi-touch (I accidently figured that one out.) Looks like we're about to start seeing the technology filter down to us. Hopefully this means more and affordable touch book technology.</p></font>

<p>Thanks for the warm welcome&#33; I think you're right to go for out-of-the-box HW, unfortunately none of those solutions&nbsp;are as nice as e.g. the Pronto (my opinion). But.. They're far more cheaper. It's even the reason for me to already bought the N810 (big hi-res screen). The new N900 phone has a smaller (but hi-res) display, that's a bit a pitty.. but still runs Meamo (that's the GUI/firmware seen by Nokia as the future for their new (hi-end) phones).</p>

<p>The problem I'm facing with my own domotica stuff is still the GUI, that needs to support "scene setting" etc.</p>

<p>Does OR support scene setting (and complex event handlers with various inputs/outputs)? I'm still learning what OR can do, it would be a waste of time to re-invent the wheel <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Scene setting yes through macro commands in the UI which are demonstrated here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/openremote#p/a/u/2/eiSaxY9bvWU">http://www.youtube.com/openremote#p/a/u/2/eiSaxY9bvWU</a></p>

<p>Complex event handlers not yet, we are currently working on how the various protocols would push status events triggered from the devices into the UI in terms of updateable components. Once that event flow is in place, we can introduce scripts and rules in the controller that react to various I/O events.</p>

The 6LoWPAN one is still experimental since the IETF and IPSO (IP for Smart Objects) are still trying to define interoperability, routing, and a couple of other things.</p>

<p>The hardware is taking longer than I expected since I keep getting sidetracked by my part-time job or helping out the hackerspace, but I do have working MCU and 2.4 GHz radio boards now. </p></font>

<p>Someone else will come up with something similar. I'm certain we're on the verge of seeing similar products become available. I'd still like to see 10" but 8" would be quite usable. The Nokia 770 is 4.5", the iPod Touch is about 3.5" and my EEE 1005HA (Netbook) is 10".</p></font>
