				    <p>I am trying to establish a connection between the OR and a media center via TCP/IP.  If I don't establish a connection the media center thinks that every command is coming from a different client and it will time out after 5 commands.  Right now when I send a command the media server will show this:</p>

<p>Server: Client #1 at 192.168.1.1:53435 connected<br/>
Server Received from client #1 at 192.168.1.1:53435: "command"<br/>
CMD: Sending "command"</p>

<p>Then the next command I send it shows this as if it was coming from something other than the OR:</p>

<p>Server: Client #2 at 192.168.1.1:53436 connected<br/>
Server Received from client #2 at 192.168.1.1:53436: "command"<br/>
CMD: Sending "command"</p>

<p>So it will only let me send 5 commands before it times out for a minute or two.  I need a way to establish a connection so it looks at the OR software as the same client for every command that is sent...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance...</p>
