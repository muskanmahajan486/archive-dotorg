				    <p>Hello OpenRemote</p>

<p>I use HomeSeer and wrote a very simple but very flexible TCP/IP interface to it for use with MediaPortal (a media centre open source project).</p>

<p>It comprises a simple HomeSeer server client and (for MP) a client GUI - but you can drive it using just Telnet&#33; All you have to do is connect to it and then send an xml fragment (details are on the forum I think).</p>

<p>If you want you can use it and adapt it for OpenRemote - it is open source and if you search on MediaPortal's forum you'll find it.</p>

<p>I like the idea of OpenRemote but sorry to say haven't yet found a convincing reason to swap out from using HomeSeer as my base program. Maybe I just haven't looked into it enough, I should spend some time since I do feel that HomeSeer is a bit restrictive. Shame it has other areas that are so flexible (especially voice using internal telephones).</p>

<p>I've got&nbsp; James' homeseer plugin installed (listening on TCP 9472) and can send commands from a std telnet client. I've configured a command in OpenRemote as Telnet protocol witht he relevant IP and port. The text is "&lt;Request Text='TestDevice On' /&gt;"</p>

<p>When I trigger it via a button, Homeseer reports the client connected - but doesn't see the command being sent.</p>

<p>Do I need to add anything (Carriage Return etc?) do have the text sent once the port is open ?</p></font>

<p>It should add a line feed ('\u000A') character at the end of each command. However, if there's some issue with flushing the streams or something similar, you might try to add a second, dummy command after the first one using '|' as separator to see if that helps any.</p>

<p>I use a carriage return (not a line feed) I could easily change this if there's a reason or if you've got Visual Studio you can do it &lt;grin&gt;.</p>

<p>It DOES work if I use Telnet to it though - perhaps that's because I do it from Windows - which is always different from Linux&#33;</p>

<p>Heck, it's just nice that someone [else] is using it.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I confess I haven't touched OpenRemote - purely as I don't currently need to.</p>

<p>My client runs on MediaPortal (so it's usable from a TV remote) and away from the TV I use internal telphones.</p>

<p>I kept meaning to write a Telnet client for my Android telephone - but this is probably where I don't need to as OpenRemote is in the same area&#33;</p>

<p>The thing I didin't like about the HomeSeer tablet was the cost&#33; It is easy to drive using something like this and (CRLF issues aside) just works.</p>

<p>I'm not sure &gt;how&lt; I'd put this into OpenRemote anyway. I'd likely make something that others wouldn't like (I make very boring interfaces, I run Windows in Classic mode - why waste my processor drawing curvy lines?)</p>

<p>Just opening up a telnet client to HomeSeer running [my] plugin returns all the devices, events and IR commands - not sure what else is necessary.</p>

<p>So, bottom line is, sorry - haven't even looked at it (my bad, I like the idea of OpenRemote).</p></font>
