				    <p>I'm a relative noob to OpenRemote and not a Java/web developer.  However, I'm really liking what OR has to offer.  I recently added the WebConsole to my OR installation and can access it at http://&lt;ip-address&gt;:8080/webconsole.  However, when I enter this address into my web browser, I receive an error stating that the panel.xml is not found.  The settings for the Web Console show that auto discovery is on, and the controller is successfully found.  I don't see any panels, though.  So far, I have built a test panel using Android, which I can successfully see on my Android G2.  My question is what do I need to do to see a panel in the Web Console?  Do I need to create a custom panel in the Online Designer?  Or do I need to do something other than sync with Online Designer in the controller?</p>

<p>Your thoughts and advice are appreciated!</p>

I did reinstall OR recently and deleted the old directories, which were in a usr location.  Is it possible that the new installation is trying to look for the panel.xml in the previous location?  If so, is there a way for me to change a configuration to look in the current location?  Or should I consider removing the new installation and reinstalling again?</p>

<p>Also, I tried my Android phone again, and it is receiving the same panel.xml not found error.  I must've last tried before removing the previous installation.</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion, and thanks for the help!</p></font>
