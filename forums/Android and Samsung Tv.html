				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I did follow the tutorial explaining how to create a panel from the Designer and can access it via beehive url.<br/>
I created like in tutorial 3 buttons (mute, volume up and down) and it shows correctly but it get an error message when I press buttons :<br/>
"Send request error<br/>
The command was sent to an invalid URL"</p>

<p>The tutorial doesn't show that for each command there is a need of an ip address (I typed my Samsung tv ip address that I want to remote control). I assume that the tutorial wasn't refreshed. It says that we need to manually type the ip address into the controller.xml file. I opened this file after saving the panel as a zip file and I found it is strange that it contains so many lines (information ie related to one of the buttons seems to repeat many times).</p>

<p>I read that the first time I would be asked to authorize my device to connect to the tv but no message appears.</p>

<p>I didn't find where I need to copy the zip on my android device. Does anyone know ?</p>

<p>Your help is welcome. I've been looking for such a program for months now so I'm very happy but frustrated that it doesn't work for me.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

thank you very much for your so fast answer.<br/>
Sorry, maybe I forgot to mention that I installed the Controller on my android devices (phone and tablet).<br/>
Do you think the problem comes from the fact that the panel comes from the internet and is not located locally on the devices ?<br/>
I tried to find a log file and the folder where to copy the zip but didn't find.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Jo</p>

<p>Maybe I can help.</p>

<p>You didn't install the controller on your Phone and Tablet <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>  What you probably did is install the Apps on your Phone and Tablet, but you certainly didn't install the controller.</p>

<p>Let me explain. The system works by having your phone and tablet talk back to a PC (or Server PC). The Wifi Control Signals do not go from your phone/tablet to your Samsung TV, they have to go from your Phone/Tablet back to the PC running the OpenRemote Controller and then the PC running the Controller sends out the TCP/IP to the Samsung TV.</p>

<p>So you have to have a PC running in the background all of the time.</p>

<p>The Apps on your phone and tablet need to be configured in the settings to find the PC running the Controller (e.g. 192.168.1.x:8080/controller), then in your panel design for each command you set a TCP/IP string for your Samsung. So you press a button, and TCP/IP command is sent back to your PC, and your PC then sends the command to the Samsung.</p>

<p>Does that help?</p></font>

Oh, yes, it helps a lot, thank you <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
I've got a Synology nas and read I can install the controller on it.<br/>
Now I understand, great.<br/>
The bad thing is that you need to have a pc or nas constantly up.<br/>
For my curiosity, why isn't it possible to have the device (phone, tablet in my case) to directly discuss with the tv ?<br/>
Isn't it possible to install the controller on the device ?</p>

<p>Thank you again. </p></font>

I've just found an another app, that does the same but without having to install a controller elsewhere. It's not free and won't give the name as people from openremote made their fantastic app free.</p></font>
