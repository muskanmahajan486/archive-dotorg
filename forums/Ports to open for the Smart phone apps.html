				    <p>Hello all,<br/>
    had been in another thread on USB controller but it's getting long in the tooth. This is a short question on firewall ports. I've opened port 8080 on my machine and that's giving me access to the controller config page, from my android, but not access from the Android app and panel. Does anybody know what port that uses?</p>

<p>I got some search results that suggested that tomcat was on port 8180 but that didn't help. Sorry new to all this Java services stuff.</p>
