				    <p>I just got into home automation and decided go with X10 due to extremely low entry cost. I got the CM15A usb device, which is not directly compatible with openremote.</p>

<p>I did setup ActiveHome Pro and the ActivePhone plugin that features an http api. I am already taking full advantage of that api by tightly integrating it with xbmc through eventghost.</p>

<p>I also set up openremote and designed a very basic remote for my iphone with basic labels and on/off buttons. </p>

<p>The biggest challenge is, how do I create a sensor through http??? I cannot find any info on that through the documentation or the forums.</p>

<p>The http api has a "getmodules" command that returns an xml with all the info needed about all connected devices. How do I get openremote to parse that info to figure out each device's on/off/dim state? I guess regex somehow, but how??</p>

<p>Here's an example xml returned:</p>

<p>&lt;monitor a="C"&gt;&lt;modules&gt;&lt;m a="32" t="Bedroom Light" o="0" b="0.000000" r="My Room"/&gt;&lt;m a="33" t="Living Room" o="1" b="0.604762" r="My Room"/&gt;&lt;m a="34" t="Fish Tank" o="1" b="1.000000" r="My Room"/&gt;&lt;/modules&gt;&lt;/monitor&gt;</p>


<p>The return values for modules are:</p>

<p>a = module code (house code + unit code)<br/>
t = device name<br/>
o = on/off state<br/>
b = dim state<br/>
r = room it belongs to in AHP</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>OK, I am trying to simplify this. I figured out a different http api that returns results for a single device in plain text. So I should not need any regex. However, I am still unable to setup the association between sensor state and http response.</p>

<p>When I send the query command for the specific device I get the following results</p>

<p>For device "ON":</p>

<p>Living Room:C2:Power Line:100</p>

<p>For device "OFF":</p>

<p>Living Room:C2:Power Line:0</p>

<p>I created a custom sensor and tried to associate the name: "on" without the quotes with value: "Living Room:C2:Power Line:100" without the quotes and did the same with off as well.</p>

<p>However my switch simply won't switch, it is stuck in the off state.</p>

<p>I also created a label with the same sensor command. The label is supposed to display "ON" for on state and "OFF" for off state. However the label keeps displaying "Living Room:C2:Power Line:100" or "Living Room:C2:Power Line:0" depending on the state of the device which means the return response is not being interpreted by openremote controller as an on/off state. </p>


<p>Am I not on the right track?? I would appreciate any help as I am getting really frustrated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi John, I really appreciate your response, however, getting different hardware that supports different protocols is not in my best interest at the moment.</p>

<p>The computer is running my media server so it is already on 24/7. Power usage is no concern. </p>

<p>I also have absolutely no problems with ActiveHome Pro. It does everything it is supposed to, and it does it well. It also receives http commands from openremote and responds properly with the status of the device.</p>

<p>My problem is with getting openremote controller to interpret the response. It should be pretty simple as the response is plain text and device specific (no regex necessary). I am sure openremote is capable of doing that, but I just don't know how because there is no documentation for http get. </p>

<p>I read almost every message on all four forums and read through all the tutorials, references and faq's and all I saw was a few other people asking the same questions about http status polling and they never got a response either. (I did try to go through the src files but I am no developer and have no knowledge of Java)</p>

<p>I was under the impression that openremote was highly capable and ready for testing (if not ready for prime time) as it is already on version 2.0. But as a highly curious beta tester, I am having great difficulty figuring out the simplest task. </p>

<p>To me it seems like openremote is being used mainly by "developers" and people who use it with KNX as there is native support for that.</p>

<p>But a software that is supposed to be "open" and universal cannot support only one system. Supporting http get (among other protocols) provides great versatility to openremote as there are many different standards for home automation with many different software, but almost all of those software have some sort of an http api. </p>

<p>I am a little disappointed, and about to give up. HSTouch designer for Homeseer seems to do pretty much everything openremote is supposed to do plus more. You can create custom interfaces that run on android and ios through native applications with rss feeds, etc. It can control and interface with Z-wave, X10, Insteon, UPB, IR, security alarms, ip cams, RFID devices and also windows media center, itunes, XBMC, etc.</p>

<p>The only downside is it costs $600 for Homeseer + HSTouch, but it works, it is easy to figure out, and there is a ton of support through their community forums where the developers participate in as well.</p>

<p>Hopefully in the future, openremote will continue to mature and support more platforms (not just through code but through documentation as well). Maybe I will come back and give it another shot then. </p>


<p>By the way, John I didn't mean to lash out at you, I really do appreciate your response, but I just got really frustrated with my inability to figure this out and needed to vent.</p>

<p>Thanks</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi X,</p>

<p>Don't give up. Homeseer will require additional hardware to support the additional feature you talked about, which can added up the cost quickly. OpenRemote is more reasonable priced with promising future.</p>

<p>I thought your original post was getting X10 to work, which in my experience is pretty good, if you install the noise filter and signal bridge at your power main. Those are really low cost devices, probably less than $50 &#8211; you can get very good quality noise filter and signal bridge for X10.  Compared to the Z-wave UPB those can cost you as much as $100 per node.</p>

<p>Good luck with your effort, I think OpenRemote will do very well for you.</p></font>

I know this an old posting but I am in the same boat now.<br/>
Can you tell me what api did you use to get the following?</p>

<p>For device "ON":</p>

<p>Living Room:C2:Power Line:100</p>

<p>For device "OFF":</p>

<p>Living Room:C2:Power Line:0 I understand that this is from ActivePhone and I do not have it currently but I am considering buying it. However before that I wanted to be sure that I will be able to get the feedback from the software as you mention above. Thanks for the help.</p></font>
