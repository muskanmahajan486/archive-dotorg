				    <p>Hi Everyone, I hope someone can help me with this issue.</p>

<p>I am sending a KNX Connect Request to an IP Interface like this:<br/>
06:10:02:05:00:1a:08:01:c0:a8:02:c6:c3:50:08:01:c0:a8:02:0a:0e:57:04:04:02:00</p>

<p>And I get a correct response with no errors:<br/>
06:10:02:06:00:14:1a:00:08:01:c0:a8:02:0a:0e:57:04:04:ff:ff</p>

<p>Then when I try to send a Tunneling Request (to control an actuator):<br/>
06:10:04:20:00:15:04:1a:00:00:11:00:b4:e0:00:00:00:01:01:00:80</p>

<p>I get a DISCONNECT RESPONSE after about 6-10 seconds:<br/>
06:10:02:09:00:10:1a:00:08:01:c0:a8:02:0a:0e:57</p>

<p>The thing is, the KNX telegram is actually transmitted on the bus (after a 3-4 second delay) and the actuator I am trying to control actually works. But I get a DISCONNECT Response along with the 3-4 sec delay!</p>

<p>I read somewhere on the forums that I should use a different port for the tunneling request and for the connect request. I have tried that as well and it yields the same result. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
