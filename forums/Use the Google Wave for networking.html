				    <p>I would like to suggest using Google Wave as a networking solution for smart houses.</p>

<p>Google Wave offers instant communications and the possibility of simple scripting in an open source environment.  As it is hosted from a server, it can be accessed from anywhere with internet access.</p>

<p>Your house would have it's own wave address. Each item you own would have one as well. Just add the item to a wave and it would streamline the networking. For example, if you are at work, your house temperature may be 80 degrees. Your system know that it takes 12 minutes to bring the temperature to 70. When you are on your way home, your smartphone Waves your house that you are 12 minutes from home (using GPS, speed and road reports). Your home is perfect when you get there.</p>

<p>If you are not familar with this up and coming technology, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ" title="Wave developer preview on youtube">developer preview</a> it is 1 hour 20 minutes long so make some popcorn.</p>

<p>I'm less sure about the Home Automation use, yet. But of course it's still very early. As of today I think Wave is still 'vapour ware' ...</p></font>

<p>The second part is interesting but a faulty premise. If I'm 12 minutes from home how does the system know I'm going home? The biggest part of the problem is not the communications protocol it's the required AI. I don't think any HA software has the required level of AI software needed to make these kinds of decisions.And as for addressing, we've got IPV6 who could need more address (said with much sarcasm). I also have concerns about how the addressing protocol works and the communication path of the data. For now I have other things that concern me, with respect to home automation, so I'll concentrate on them.</p>

<p>For the moment I'll sit back and observe the technology and see what happens. We have enough inventing to do around here to keep us busy for a while. It may prove to be useful but I'm taking a wait-n-see posture at this time.</p></font>
