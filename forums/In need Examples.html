				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Could someone upload examples for using blinds as well a macros.<br/>
I want to calculate to need for water warming (Water Tank) as an outcome of the amount of sunny hours and temp per day.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Nir</p>

<p>We need to know what protocols you want to use, blinds doesn't mean anything unless we know what is controlling them.</p>

<p>I use KNX. I also have need for Weather station examples and some tutorial with Macros, which I guess goes hand in hand.</p>

<p>Found the tutorial of the Macros.<br/>
It is only kind of sequencer.<br/>
I need more complex stuff like integrating the light and temp levels in order to find out if the water tank is to be switched on or so.<br/>
I need time based functions etc. as well as blinds control.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Nir,</p>

<p>Yes macros only offer you delays and sequences of commands what you need is rules. Search the forums for "rules" and/or "drools" and you should find some examples.</p>

<p>The KNX protocol sends/reads to the various group addresses and I don't know off the top of my head whether or not all the DPT (Data Point Types) you will need have been added to the KNX protocol but again the forums should help there.</p>

<p>I have a KNX installation that uses an outdoor Merten temp/light sensor and have it setup to open a window if the temperature is above a certain threshold and it also activates a panel of smart glass when the light level exceeds a threshold. All the logic for this has been implemented in the KNX modules (InZennio actuators have logic functions built in). I prefer to keep as much KNX logic inside the KNX network but there are limits to what you can do without buying expensive logic units.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Richard,</p>

<p>As far as I have seen from the documentation of the OR KNX Command name, it looks like the OR does not support all DPT.<br/>
It does not support 1.002 (Boolean), 1.003 (Enable), 1.008 (Up/Down), 1.009 (Open/Close), 1.010 (Start/Stop). These are all 1 bit.<br/>
It does not support ASCII at all (I have no use for it at the moment),<br/>
It does not support 5.003 (Angle), 5.010 (1 byte unsigned counter), 6.010 (1 byte signed value).</p>

<p>The most important is the Up/Down and Start/Stop which are part of the Blinds control. Blinds are very elementary stuff.<br/>
As for the weather staion thresholds, it is quit elementary as all of this is built inside the triggering mechanizm of the waether unit. Mine have 7 levels with an option to remote update of some threshlds (not part of programming). Nevertheless, it has Temp, Light Rain and Wind measurement.<br/>
I wanted to have logic on a trail and error basic for my gardening (block irrigation if it is rainy outside or not, water tank control in the winter etc.). The Weather station has all these parameters measured but all of this requires calculative decisions. <br/>
As I understand, the rules will do the job but as for the Blinds or Curtains for that matter as well, I see no solution yet as part of the OR unless I am wrong.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>This is in general true but in the case of blinds the Actuators work in XOR mode (Up/Down/None). That means I have no Group Address for the Up and a different one for the Down. I The Start/Stop is Off mode of the Up and the Down (No relay is active of the two relays involved in the specific Blind control).<br/>
Since I have no control on the field on the number inside the Actuator I can't operate the Blind.<br/>
I suggest to look at the definitions of the Actuator and Panels to see thses facts. All this logic is behind the logic of the H/W.</p>

<p>Please let me know if there is anything to do.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
