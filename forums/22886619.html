				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>First post here. After evaluating quite a few different approaches to home automation, I ended up seeing open remote as the one that has the greatest potential.</p>

<p>Sure it took a little tinkering on my Synology NAS and android phone, but it was way easier to get something working than with any other approach so Kudos to the designers.</p>

<p>Now to my (newbie) question:</p>

<p>My netradio offer rest like HTTP services and can return a station list like this sample:</p>

<p>&lt;fsapiResponse&gt;<br/>
&lt;status&gt;FS_OK&lt;/status&gt;<br/>
&lt;item key="0"&gt;<br/>
&lt;field name="name"&gt;<br/>
&lt;c8_array&gt;DR P7 MIX&lt;/c8_array&gt;<br/>
&lt;/field&gt;<br/>
&lt;/item&gt;<br/>
&lt;item key="1"&gt;<br/>
&lt;field name="name"&gt;<br/>
&lt;c8_array&gt;DR MAMA&lt;/c8_array&gt;<br/>
&lt;/field&gt;<br/>
&lt;/item&gt;<br/>
&lt;/fsapiResponse&gt;</p>

<p>Potentially giving me 20 presets in one go. The key is then used for selecting a preset and the name is of course needed in the UI.</p>

<p>What I do now for each preset is create: 1 command using key, 1 sensor getting the name, 1 button for command and 1 label for the station name.<br/>
While this works it is tedious to create all these objects and I'm wondering how the more experienced people in here would solve this?</p>

<p>I could run a shell exec to populate a lot of sensors in one go (saving on the number of requests) but that is just optimizing and doesn't reduce the number of objects<br/>
Ideally I would like to have one sensor and one command with a variable URL (only the key ID changes) that could be reused for all the GUI buttons or maybe even for a dropdown selection list, but now I'm starting to dream....</p>

<p>Suggestions are very welcome.</p>

<p>Be gentle - This is my first post, remember? <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>
