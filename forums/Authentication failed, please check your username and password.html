				    <p>I am a new user attempting to evaluate this system with a view to a Home Automation implementation in about three months time.<br/>
As I go through the attempts to "Sync with Online Designer" I get the message "Authentication failed, please check your username and password".<br/>
I have used the contact link and they have tried to help, but no success so I thought that it might be best to post to the forum as this would probably have a larger audience.<br/>
First possible problem was that I hadn't realised that the openremote.org site and designer had separate logins and was hopeful that may have been the problem, but i went through a process of ensuring I had identical logins and passwords for both cases and also, in the (remote) possibility that the download had a parameter inserted that tied it to a particular username, started from scratch with a new download.<br/>
I run Windows 7 on a 64 bit system, this is not necessarily where the final installation would run, but it is the environment in which I want to do my evaluation. I followed the XP instructions (there were no instructions for Windows 7) on the page "Install OpenRemote 2.0 Controller".<br/>
From the /bin directory I performed the open run as specified on that page.</p>

<p>C:\Paul\Home\HomeAutomation\OpenRemote-Controller-2.1.0_SNAPSHOT-2013-06-17\bin&gt;openremote run</p>

<p>The following appeared in the window.</p>

<p>At this point it was waiting for me to launch the browser (Firefox). I entered the username and password. Clicking the Sync button produced this message in the window.</p>

<p>followed many lines of the form</p>

<p>        at org.openremote.controller.service.Deployer$BeehiveConnection.downloadZip(Deployer.java:1492)</p>

<p>which I haven't listed as it would appear the error has already occurred and been reported.<br/>
Sure enough, there is no file controller.xml in the reported directory above, though there are several with that name further down the tree, in sub directories of OpenRemote-Controller-2.1.0_SNAPSHOT-2013-06-17\webapps\controller\WEB-INF\classes\org\openremote\controller</p>

<p>I think that is the full story. If anyone has any ideas, I would be grateful.</p>
