				    <p>Wow the forums suddenly exploded and I'm loving it!</p>

<p>Last night I saw a quick commercial on something called the power pad <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/help_16.gif" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>. It's 'wireless power' (god I hate buzzwords). It's a pad that plugs into the wall and you attach a thin device to the back of your phone, ipod, gameboy, whatever and it recharges the unit when you place the device on the pad. Really not magic or anything new if you understand transformers and/or RFID. Just thought it might be of interest to those of us with too many gadgets and not enough outlets. And yes I realize that it shifts the problem from the wall wart to having the correct device on the back of my phone. The closest link I could find was this:</p>

                                            <div class="tabletitle">

                        </div>

                        <table border="0" width="100%">
                                                        <tr>
                                <td >
                                    <a name="comment-4948319"></a>
                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Well I just saw the commercial again and it's the <a href="http://www.powermat.com/">power mat</a> not the power pad. I've also found&nbsp; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/06/powermat-hands-on/">something</a> from our friends at Engadget and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5376793/powermat-charger-has-no-f-wires">something</a> from Gizmodo. I love the commercial&#33;</p>

<p>The comments on both blast the device as moronic. While I have my concerns about efficiency it can still be useful if it doesn't waste a lot of power. The suggested cost is $100 for the mat and $40 for each adapter (ouch&#33;). With Europe standardizing the power interface something like this might be unnecessary. Also some devices get a puck, a large device that looks like a hockey puck but with a cord to plug into battery powered device. At that point it's not much of a difference with respect to the wall wart.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>What is the European effort you refer to? What exactly is being standardized?  I always thought that a low-voltage standard plug would remove the power supply for the laptop/lights/phones and every little thing.  Obviously how to get this thing in the field is complicated so a EU standard might be interesting in that respect. </p>
