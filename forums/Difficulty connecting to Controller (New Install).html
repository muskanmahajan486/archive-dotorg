				    <p>I am sorry but I have not been able to resolve my problem connection to the controller via the web page.  I am able to launch the controller and the controller appears to start up.  In terminal the information message controller starting in xxx ms is displayed and the cursor goes away.  I then launch the browser with the "localhost:8688/controller"  I did edit the server.xml file changing port 8080 to 8688.  This did not seem to work.  I have searched the forums without much help.  Im a newbie but trying to get this excellent software to work.  I am sure I am doing something wrong.  Please help.  <br/>
Thank,<br/>
Randy</p>

I did notice that I had the controller installed under Program Files directory in windows.  I have since learned that the controller does not like spaces in folder names.  I relocated the controller to C:\openremote and everything worked fine.  A hard lesson since it is documented everywhere to not have spaces in the path.  Anyway thank you for your help and I am off to the next challenge.<br/>
