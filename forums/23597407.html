				    <p>Title says it all. I've got a few Pi units and I'm currently using the QNAP for OR. Any preference to using it on the Pi?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I guess I'll reply to my own question since it's been a month without feedback. &lt;eye-roll&gt; </p>

<p>I tried both. I found similar challenges as a Linux noob: folder locations and rights are not my thing and they're not all as perfect as they seem in theory. </p>

<p>I still am unable to "Reload configuration and clear cache" from the Controller web UI on either platform; but stop/start the process works fine for any significant changes. No clue if clearing the cache would help in some way. But overall, both worked fine. </p>

<p>The TS639Pro unit I have is pretty old but performance seemed nearly identical to using an RPi2. I finally settled on using the Pi just so I'm not futzing around with my primary storage system on a regular basis. For example, I'm modifying the HOSTS file so that I can use names in IP-based control devices instead of IP addresses (in case I change them later). And some of the configs (Russound, ISY, others?) involve modifying text config files on the controller, so... I'd rather not make a habit of SSH'ing to my primary storage system. </p>

<p>The Pi has had intermittent SD-card corruption issues; but hopefully are either resolvable by using different "more compatible" SD cards or perhaps the latest kernel fixes might have resolved it. They just came out last night, so we'll see. On the plus side, being able to go to the GUI in the Pi (RDP to X) and just grab a copy of the config files and dump them on my server gives me confidence in getting it back and running if there are issues. Also, making an image of a 4GB MicroSD card is pretty easy and makes "restore" an easy thing, too. </p>

<p>I added some current / updated information to the Raspberry Pi how-to doc since the latest boxes are a bit different (Oracle JAVA is included / ready) than the old write-up. Be sure to do rpi-update regularly as they are still writing firmware fixes regularly. </p>

<p>Hope this helps someone else with a similar question. </p></font>
