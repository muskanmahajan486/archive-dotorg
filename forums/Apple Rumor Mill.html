				    <p>I'd take this with a large grain of salt but it's fun to speculate: <img src="attachments/951242/884765.png" align="right" alt="EeeTop" border="0" height="128" hspace="20" title="Will Apple have a competitor to EeeTop?" vspace="5" width="128"/></p>

<blockquote><p>TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple will take third-quarter delivery of newly developed 10-inch touchscreens from Taiwan, a source said on Wednesday, amid talk the U.S. firm is developing a touchscreen PC.</p>

<p>Taiwan touchscreen specialist Wintek already makes small screens for Apple iPhones, and has received orders for the larger ones that are roughly the same size as those used in mini PCs, said the source close to the Taiwan firm. He asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media.</p>

<p>Taiwan media reported this week that Apple, which has brought touchscreens to the forefront with the success of its iPhones, is currently developing a touchscreen PC, as lines begin to blur between sophisticated smartphones and traditional PCs.</p>

<p>Some of those reports have said that Taiwan's Quanta Computer, the world's top contract laptop PC maker, would manufacture the actual PCs for Apple.</p>

<p>Apple's Hong Kong spokeswoman, Jill Tan, said the company did not comment on market speculation, while a Quanta spokeswoman also declined to comment.</p></blockquote>

<p>We here at OpenRemote of course welcome any kind of additional touchscreen capable panel hardware, as long as we can put our OSS code on them. We've toyed with the idea of using Asus EeeTop as a wall panel (picture in the top right corner) and I in fact have one on the desk waiting for me to pay more attention to it.</p>

<p>More alternatives is better &#8211; nobody wants to spend $4,000 just to get a touch screen on their wall.</p>
