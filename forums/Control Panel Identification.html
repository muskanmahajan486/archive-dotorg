				    <p>Hello All!</p>

<p>I have a quick question that I have tried everything I could to find the answer to with no luck.  What I am trying to achieve is something that I would imagine would be a useful feature to have but I can't seem to think of a way to pull this off.</p>

<p>Basically what I am trying to do is this:<br/>
I would like to build one standard panel to control miscellaneous items (such as lights and media equipment) that will run on a separate tablet located in each room.  Each tablet will then reference the same panel but depending on which tablet sends the commands to the controller, it will affect only the devices in that room. That way, for example, I could press a button to turn the TV on and it would know the command came from the tablet in the Living Room and turn that TV on, yet pushing the same button on the tablet in the Bedroom would only affect the bedroom TV. The only way I can think of is to create a separate panel for each room which can be cumbersome when you want one interface change to affect all rooms since you would have to update several panels/screens.</p>


<p>Ideally, I would like to be able to pass a "Control Panel ID" (be it an IP address, MAC address, or some configurable ID number) as a parameter/variable with any outgoing message (or at least with the HTTP or TCP protocols) like the {$params} variable or maybe in this case a "{$panelID}" so I can isolate which tablet sent the message to the controller. </p>

<p>Is this possible, or does anyone know a way to achieve the ability to send a custom identifier to be able to tell which device sent the message to the controller?</p>


<p>Thanks for any input!</p>

At the moment you could first make your base design and save that as a template. Based on this template make a customised <b>panel</b> for each room. Configure your tablets to load that panel at startup.<br/>
It is a bit of work (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXyzm61_eZE">video</a>) but can be very rewarding</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Unfortunately, it is not quite possible right now. I've made a similar function, use one panel design for many rooms. However, I've achieved this by running it on multiply controllers, i.e. each room had it's own controller instance. All controllers are running on a single Ubuntu server. It is a part of this <a href="https://youtu.be/IVufkXq6U3Y">project</a>. Anyway, I've used single panel design with some custom sensors which loaded their value from a text file. Each room had a different string there, this way I could address specific room and make panel to look bit different per room. However, this bit was a special step, not included in Openremote architecture yet. Shell editing, ssh, vi, etc. Hard stuff <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>If you want to have a single controller, then the solution proposed by PZ1 would be better.</p></font>
