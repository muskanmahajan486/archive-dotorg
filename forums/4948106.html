				    <p>Welll I've been doing a lot of reading but I've gotten to a point where I can't quite decide which transceiver to get.</p>

<p>I've narrowed it down to these four:</p>

<p>BC4+BCX-1 &#45;--Bitwise Controls
<a href="http://www.bitwisecontrols.com/products.php">http://www.bitwisecontrols.com/products.php</a><br/>
IRTrans Ethernet
<a href="http://www.irtrans.de/en/shop/lan.php">http://www.irtrans.de/en/shop/lan.php</a><br/>
CommandIR II
<a href="http://www.commandir.com/content/view/32/48/">http://www.commandir.com/content/view/32/48/</a><br/>
USB-IR transceiver &#45;--IguanaWorks
<a href="http://iguanaworks.net/">http://iguanaworks.net/</a></p>

<p>The last one isn't really contender I think because it's not very featureful compared to the others.</p>

<p>Then again, despite being featureful the IRTrans device does have one big knock against it that this one doesn't.</p>

<p>It's built-in trasmitter only has one port....</p>

<p>This port can have up to 6 emitters but one can only output the same codeset at the same time via these emitters.</p>

<p>A second port can be added, but even then one cannot transmit two different code-sets from the two ports (via emitters) at the same time&#33;</p>

<p>I'd love to hear peoples thoughts/experiences surrounding these devices and which you'd recommend and why&#33;</p>

<p>Thanks heaps,</p>

<p>Jed</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Sharing some of my previous responses on the forums as well:</p>

<p>1) I'm not familiar with Bitwise Controls so can't say anything about that.</p>

<p>2) IRTrans is in use by some in the OR community already and as far as I've been able to gather the experience has been positive. </p>

<p>In addition we are discussing with IRTrans on how we can further develop our integration to provide even better experience with IRTrans products. So on the long run this may be a good choice if you're planning to use it with OpenRemote.</p>

<p>I've pinged them on your question about channels. Even if the same code is blasted on all channels this is generally not an issue since the IR codes tend to be distinct and ignored by devices that don't understand them. Depends a bit on the size of your deployment what the real impact is.</p>

<p>3) CommandIR II, obviously we've tested and it's part of our reference hardware setup with LIRC at the moment. </p>

<p>4) IguanaWorks, tested but had driver issues when using through LIRC. The ticket I created on this has now been closed and supposedly issue is fixed, however I haven't been able to test and confirm it.</p>

<p>I actually liked IguanaWorks a lot for sort of quick and dirty deployments to test IR integration due to its small form factor and low price. Where it may lack features I think it has its uses as well.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for your thoughts,</p>

<p>I've ruled out iguana as it only has a max of four emitters, I'll prolly need more than that eventually.</p>

<p>I've ruled out global cache too as they make no mention of Linux support on their site.....</p>

<p>This leaves only:</p>

But is knocked out ultimately as it's slightly feature limited &amp; they were a little unresponsive.</p>

<p>CommandIR is knocked out as they were very unresponsive, &amp; whenever they did it was quite terse/laboured.</p>

<p>Bitwise is knocked out as it's trying to be more than just an IR transceiver.<br/>
This is all well &amp; good but I'm not yet building a HA controller box utilising The Boss etc.<br/>
Also a little unresponsive...</p>

<p>This leaves only IRTrans;<br/>
They were extremely responsive/helpful at all times<br/>
they seem to have very solid software support/dev/doco<br/>
They are pricier in-terms of hardware/$ ratio, but IMO but that can be overlooked.<br/>
And last but not least...<br/>
When I move ahead on a OR-based implementation they are supported <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Interesting thread.</p>

<p>The IRTrans product is especially interesting since I have ethernet available anywhere in the house using HomePlug.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it may be challenging or expensive to order from across the pond.&nbsp; I'll have to look into that...</p>

<p>The thing I liked best about the IRTrans unit (if I read the specs correctly) is that external transmitters/receivers are optional, not required.&nbsp; This is desirable for me because I prefer to blast a strong signal from a box (like a consumer all-in-one remote) rather than have wires to the front of all my home theater equipment since the equipment is out in the open.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>This is correct, but apparently the built-in receiver doesn't cover all frequencies used by CIR.<br/>
It covers the frequencies used by the vast majority, but not all...</p>


<p>So if you have problems you may have to invest in the external receiver for learning purposes etc.<br/>
It's range is much worse than the built-in receiver, only 1m from memory...</p>

<p>I pestered Marcus for ages asking dozens of questions, so if you have any more let me know.<br/>
I'll then see if I have the answer in our email correspondence, that way we can leave the poor guy be <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>For Windows and Mac-based setups, IRTrans and GlobalCache for infrared control are good options. They're IP-based making the setup easier and you can leave your controller in your basement if you're already set with appropriate ethernet infrastructure.</p>

<p>I'll try to get more info on installing, setting up and comparing both products with OpenRemote Boss online on the wiki. Input, opinions, feedback, contributions in this area also very welcome.</p>

<p>If you've already checked the comparison matriix on their their site, and are still unsure...</p>

<p>Then I'd be speaking to Marcus (info[at]irtrans.de)....</p>

<p>He was by far the friendliest &amp; most helpful/responsive of all the transceiver companies I approached.</p>

<p>I'd give commandIR a wide berth for opposite reasons.</p>

<p>Can't help you Re other questions, I really haven't delved far into all this yet.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I would suggest the &#45;DB module. That one stores the trained ir codes right inside the irtrans box and you don't need the irtrans server software running on a pc. The &#45;MOD version need the irtrans server software which is LIRC compatible. The &#45;DB version, you can directly all from BOSS using our TCP/IP commands the &#45;MOD version can be controlled via LIRC. I think the &#45;DB version is easier to use, although a little more expensive <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I also have the &#45;DB version.</p></font>
