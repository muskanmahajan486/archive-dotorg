				    <p>In my home automation setup, I use an ISY-994i as the controller and OpenRemote for control. I really like this setup. However, I always wanted it to be able to wake me up by turning the lights on in my room and playing music on my stereo when my alarm clock went off. I have searched Google for a good solution, but was not able to find one that I particularly cared for.</p>

<p>This was my motivation to creating OpenAlarm. I have just released version 1. OpenAlarm is a very small footprint program that operates as the "brains" behind the alarm clock. You can interact with the alarm clock in many ways. Personally, I use OpenRemote to create a nice GUI on my phone. I set the alarm for any time I would like and activate it. Just like a normal alarm clock. The alarm is configured to trigger different programs on my ISY to run when the alarm performs actions.</p>

<p>When my alarm clock sounds, my lights dim on slowly over a few minutes and my TV is turned on. Then a playlist is started on XBMC. Slowly the volume on my stereo creeps up until I am awake (I'm a heavy sleeper). When I press the snooze button, the music immediately cuts out and the lights turn back off. The volume is turned back down and the TV and receiver are turned back off until the alarm sounds again. When I silence my alarm, the music turns on in the bathroom, the lights come on to their normal level, and the volume is turned back down a bit. </p>

<p>All of these are programs in my ISY that OpenAlarm triggers.</p>

<p>This has been useful to me and I'm hoping that someone else will find use with it as well. A detailed wiki has been included on the project page to help you get started. In the wiki, I have also included a large write-up about integration with OpenRemote. If you have any feedback on the project, let me know.</p>

<p>It looks great! Very good job indeed. I like the user interface and also great job of putting documentation together. Also good to see more ISY-99 users reporting back to us <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Let me know if there's anything we can do to help? Would a write up highlighting your work on the blog or newsletter be of interest? Is there anything you'd like to add to the openremote.org side in the wiki?</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
