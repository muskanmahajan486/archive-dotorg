				    <p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>looking at the latest code in trunk I saw that the iPhone console includes a lot of code for the ORB discovery and also on the controller side quite some work. I was wondering if the "zeroconf" specifications would help making this much easier to implement?</p>

<p>On the iPhone side the Bonjour service is already there to use and implements the zeroconf protocols and for the controller side we could use jmdns which is distributed under the apache licence.</p>

<p>Here is a presentation which describes the stuff:<a href="http://www.bosatsu.net/talks/JmDNS.pdf">http://www.bosatsu.net/talks/JmDNS.pdf</a><br/>
You can find JmDNS on sourceforge: <a href="http://jmdns.sourceforge.net/">http://jmdns.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>On the iPhone side you just create a delegate to react on bonjour events and start NSNetServiceBrowser. The code would be a&nbsp; 3-liner :
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">id delegateObject; <span class="code-comment">// Assume <span class="code-keyword">this</span> exists.
</span>NSNetServiceBrowser *serviceBrowser;
serviceBrowser = [[NSNetServiceBrowser alloc] init];
[serviceBrowser setDelegate:delegateObject];
[serviceBrowser searchForServicesOfType:@<span class="code-quote">"_orb._tcp"</span> inDomain:@""];
</pre>
</div></div>What do you think?</p>

				    
                                            <div class="tabletitle">
                            <a name="comments">Comments:</a>

<p>As I know from experience, we will have to register a service type ID somewhere (I will have to check) - I did this some years ago for the printers I build.</p></font>

<p>You were schnoozing while we were furously chatting yesterday so I will give you a summerized version: write once, run everywhere. Means more distribution for us.</p>


<p>JP Joubert, an integrator&nbsp; you have seen writing on the sales alias says "can I test on my PC" (meaning windows).&nbsp; He uses KNX.&nbsp; Answer: yes, in principle it should work AS IS on a windows PC. The bottom line there will be that it will be easier to test. Lower barrier to adoption is good.</p>

<p>KNX uses Calimero, Calimero is pure java, voila&#33;</p>

<p>unfortunatetly not everything is java and there I agree we should prioritize linux support for the ORB. </p></font>

In principle yes, but. At least for Java applets it is not true. My collegue lost a lot of hair writing his applets so they could run properly on the different VMs, different Java versions and so on. Even the same Java versions behave differently on Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>However, I agree that Java is great for applications without need of direct control of the underlying system. But we should concentrate on the OR system itself. If there's already support for some things in the system (like the mDNS here), there's no need to do the work twice.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Marcus,</p>

<p>I was looking for something like application discovery for another project. There is many ways to do it, Bonjour is one of them, and in OR case, can be very usefull as it is native to the IPhone as you mentionned.</p>

<p>I has also a look with UPnP and DPWS for the same usage, assuming that a DHCP server is available on the target network (which is often the case in automated houses).</p>

<p>My guess is that on such a project, all "discovery" protocols may be used... </p></font>

<p>Just login to your ORB (Alix with Voyage linux assumed):</p>
<div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<pre>remountrw
apt-get install avahi-daemon
cd /etc/avahi/services
vi orb.service
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Now put the following XML into the new file:</p>
<div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?&gt;&lt;!--*-nxml-*--&gt;

    &lt;port&gt;80&lt;/port&gt;
  &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/service-group&gt;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Just restart avahi now (<tt>/etc/init.d/avahi restart</tt>).</p>

<p>Et voila <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Using your favorite mDNS browser (e.g. the free mDNS app on the iPhone), you can now find a _orb._tcp service on your local net.

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Mathieu,</p>

<p>the LinuxMCE project is using the DHCP approach. But that means the LinuxMCE must be the one and only DHCP server in the house. Most of the users probably already have an internet router which acts as a DHCP server and then you have a problem.</p>

<p>Using an independent service like zeroconf would make things easier I suppose. And since we want the ORB to be the interface to all other HA hardware it's good enough if we can just detect the ORB who then will do the rest of the communication.</p></font>

<blockquote><p>What other non-iPhone clients do you have in mind? For HTML and Flash we need to enter the ORB URL in the browser anyway.</p></blockquote>

<p>What kinds of clients? All kinds. Who knows what requirements Neil will come up with! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Also I think for Flash client it should be possible to do a discovery on a local network. I was under the impression that ZeroConf can direct to mDNS for local links anyway? That's why I am asking about the client cause everybody's showing how the server-side works but what does the client query translate to? The RFC seems to indicate its a DNS client lookup to a specifically allocated IP range?</p>

<p>Does anybody have the details?</p>

<p>If the above doesn't work, then Flash client starting point should be a global static URL, such as openremote.org/config, from where you download a SWF that knows how to execute the discovery on the local network (in the browser) and then fetches the local XML UI definition. Your initial configuration becomes simpler since you don't have to figure out what the URL you connect to is (but ZeroConf is supposed to solve this, although at least for Microsoft browsers seems to require a special plugin).  At least on Flash you should have access to sockets I think. But you know that better than I do.</p>

<p>SmartHome does something like the above for browser-based discovery although I think they are using ActiveX instead of Flash.</p>

<p>For pure JavaScript it will be trickier.</p>

<p>Looking at Bonjour it looks interesting for the long term but much of an overkill for the simple ORB discovery we are targeting for 1.0. A simple multicast beacon will do. The beacon has an advantage in that the client can be fairly passive just listening for a packet, rather than having to actively connect and query DNS-SD service.</p>

<p>Also, Mathieu is correct in that we cannot live by one discovery mechanism alone. Having a ZeroConf for someone who is managing the rest of the network with UPnP is not as interesting as the UPnP native SSD protocol I think. In other HA setups beacons seem to be pretty well established. For example, GlobalCacheé unit sends out one. I believe they follow a format AMX has specified so they are manageable within an AMX installation. ORB should do the same.</p>

<p>So I wouldn't remove the existing implementation. It seems to have some issues with deployment flexibility but should turn it into a beacon-type discovery mechanism. Bonjour can be added as an extra service but it does way more than what we need for 1.0 (100+ pages of RFC after all). It becomes interesting when you don't have routed IP address (the IPv4 Link-Local RFC) or when the rest of your devices already support DNS-SD service categorization/discovery and you're using an existing browser, all your networked devices including ORB will show up. </p>

<p>So go ahead with the branch to build features but keep in mind the above points &#8211; we can do ZeroConf but we also need to integrate (UPnP, AMX, et al). Flash should still be able to do discovery. HTML discovery might work if the web browser already supports ZeroConf? Safari should but any others ?</p>

<p>Nope, not if you download it from a server. Then the flash program is only allowed to connect back to the server it came from.</p>

<p>Can you do a signed app, like with Java? I guess you can't listen on a socket for a beacon either?</p>

<p>Then I guess the only option is to find ZeroConf-enabled browser.</p>

<p>Use the source, Luke. It's two simple classes: <a href="http://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openremote/trunk/Controller/src/org/openremote/controller/net/">http://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openremote/trunk/Controller/src/org/openremote/controller/net/</a></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's not portable though <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>  Needs some fixes for deployment configuration as well.</p>
