				    <p>Dear openremote,</p>

<p>Ihave been using open remote for some months now and have managed to control my knx home automation with great success up to yesterday Thursday  21/06/13 when everything crashed. This hapend while i was trying to add some more rules and macros. most of my commands and sensors show up two and three times and clearing them does not fix anything. My antroid phone connects to the controller but my switches do not work.</p>

<p> Is it posible to restore any older version before 21/06/13??</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Stavros</p>


<p>I case that it helps i have a zip export file just before the problem occured. When i upload the zip file ofline everything works fine. I would apritiate would help as i have put a lot of effort into this and i would realy think twice having to start all over again.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>


<p>Stavros</p>
