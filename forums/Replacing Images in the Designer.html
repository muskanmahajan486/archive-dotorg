				    <p>I would like to replace an image I'm using in a lot of screens with another one.  Doing this through the designer UI would be very painful, so I would like to just replace the existing image on disk with a new one. I have been looking through the code and can not figure out how to do this.  The modeler_tmp directory and the beehive resources/userid  directory seem to get refreshed from somewhere, I just don't know where from.  So my two questions are:</p>

<p>1. How or where can I manually swap out an image for another one without using the designer UI (copy a file, change a DB value, manipulate a zip file, etc...)</p>

<p>2. How can I delete an image from my ever growing pool of images without using the designer ui (The UI for selecting images does nothing when I try to delete and image).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The resources/userid is the place to make the changes and more specifically the openremote.zip file.<br/>
This is the place where changes need to be made.</p>

<p>Please make a backup before trying this but I would:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>delete a content of modeler_tmp</li>
	<li>delete all files from resources/userid EXCEPT for openremote.zip</li>
	<li>extract openremote.zip to a temporary folder, do the changes there (delete non used images, update images you want to change) , the re-package openremote.zip and put it back in resources/userid</li>
</ul>
