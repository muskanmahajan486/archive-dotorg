				    <p>Looking through the code to port to android, I am reading the "IR Command delay" stuff as in MacrosIrDelayUtil.java.  It seems these are linked to the IR only with several references to IRCommand.  However it seems to me that there is a case for macros with delays independently of IR no? if anything the commands on GC (over IP, not seen as IR?) would require delay.  </p>

<p>If that is the case, I can go through the moves of detaching the Delay from the IR construct and offer a generic delay.  I will also investigate how it is done in the designer today and whether macros with delay are only for IR..</p>
