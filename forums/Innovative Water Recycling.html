<p>【Innovative Water Recycling】</p>

<p>A project in Peru is an excellent example of how to provide fresh drinking water, literally out of thin air. With an average humidity of 98% but a rainfall of only 2 inches per year, Lima is the second largest desert capital in the world and as such has almost continuous water supply issues. Recently however, these issues have become even more exaggerated since the Andean glaciers have shrunk between 20~50% since the 1970's.  To help combat this problem The University of Engineering and Technology of Peru and the Mayo DraftFCBand ad agency, created a new water-creating billboard.  The billboard system, works like a huge dehumidifier, by essentially using a fan to draw the air into the system, where it meets a series of cooled coils where it collects and drips through a reverse osmosis purifying system. The drinkable water is then stored in 20 liter water tanks. The water is dispensed at the bottom of the structure, which according to the school, has provided 9,450 liters in three months.</p>
