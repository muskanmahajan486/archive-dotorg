				    <p>After moving from a working project under version 2.1.0 to 2.1.1, I get tons of errors on each rule I have. <br/>
I was aware to this issue for a while but got to tackle it just now.<br/>
From the change log there is nothing relevant to this behaviour but it does mess up the project.<br/>
To be more specific, under 2.1.0 I did not get the Shell.log although I have added the needed code as defined in the forum. Under 2.1.1 it works after adding the same code.<br/>
Other than that, I get mail related errors on each of my rules.<br/>
The mail sending rule I have used was posted in the forum and it was working good for many months now.</p>

<p>The errors I get are:</p>
