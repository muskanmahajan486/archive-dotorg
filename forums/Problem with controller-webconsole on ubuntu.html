				    <p>I was able to get the webconsole UI to talk to my iTach device &amp; run some control commands I had captured successfully. But I gave up running it on the ancient and underpowered XP host I originally was working with and went ahead and installed tomcat6 and the controller on my ubuntu linux server. Everything seems fine but when I open the webconsole and fill in the URL/default panel/login/password correctly it just sits there and never opens my designed panel as it would when the old XP host was serving it. How can I get better visibility into what is happening/not happening in the controller ?</p>

<p>Thanks - Tim C</p>

<p>Tomcat logfiles are at /var/lib/tomcat6/logs<br/>
Tomcat webapps dir is at /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps</p>

<p>Besides the log4j logs I found I often need to look at the catalina log. </p>

<p>You restart tomcat using the command sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart</p></font>
