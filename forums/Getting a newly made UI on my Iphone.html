				    <p>Hi to you all,</p>

<p>I am totally new to the OpenRemote project so bear with me for a moment.<br/>
I bought the Iphone app, made an OpenRemote user account and started my first tryout.</p>

<p>First things first, I watched the demo video on YouTube about "OpenRemote - How to create navigation"<br/>
At first it seems very straight forward and I have no problem using the online "Designer app" to reproduce the same thing in the video.<br/>
BUT half way through the video they sync their project to a modeler account?? Where on this website is that explained how to do that?</p>

<p>My question is, how do I get my project on my Iphone? Are their any tutorial video's about that or some explanation how it all fit's together?</p>

<p>I hope somebody can point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Kind Regards.</p>

<p>Edwin</p>

<p>As far as I know, iPhone should work the same that the iPAD, so I'll try to give you an generic overview:<br/>
OpenRemote is working with the Designer, the once you' ve used to create the navigation &amp; UI part.<br/>
There is also the Controller. the main application that needs to run on a "server". You can download it from: 
<a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Product+Overview">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Product+Overview</a><br/>
Once you've installed the controller, you've to connect it to the "cloud" with your Designer account and sync/load your model into the controller.<br/>
Your iPhone App will communicate with the controller. The iPhone is your visualisation application, but this is the controller that sends command to your installation.</p>

<p>Hope this can help</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Philippe,</p>

<p>Thank you for the fast reply. You said the following:</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; As far as I know, iPhone should work the same that the iPAD, so I'll try to give you an generic overview:<br/>
&gt;&gt; OpenRemote is working with the Designer, the once you' ve used to create the navigation &amp; UI part.</p>

<p>---- Done that, and this works.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; As far as I know, iPhone should work the same that the iPAD, so I'll try to give you an generic overview:<br/>

<p>---- Done that, and this works also.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Your iPhone App will communicate with the controller.</p>

<p>---- FAIL, how does the phone exactly communicate?</p>

<p>For the moment the application on the iphone is not "stable" it quits suddenly without any reason.<br/>
If I do get it running, it runs only for a brief moment of time (probably still a bug in there somewhere)?<br/>
But okay, lets say it runs smoothly, then in the settings of the Iphone app you have,</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Gateway, adress, search gateway</li>
	<li>Parameters, .....</li>
	<li>.... and so on</li>
</ul>


<p>What do I put in Gateway adress? If I put in the IP of my "server" (laptop pc) and press "search gateway" I see nothing?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for any info you provide.<br/>
Kind regards,</p>

<p>Edwin</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Sorry my bad,</p>

<p>I recently discovered that there are 3 version of OpenRemote on the app store:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>OpenRemote KNX Lite</li>
	<li>OpenRemote KNX (costs 14,99euro, this is the one that I bought)</li>
	<li>OpenRemote Console (is the one used in the video)</li>
</ul>


<p>Everything seems to be working now.</p>
