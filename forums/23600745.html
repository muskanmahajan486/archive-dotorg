				    <p>I'm using the online designer here: <a href="https://composer.openremote.org/demo/login.jsp">https://composer.openremote.org/demo/login.jsp</a> </p>

<p>And I seem to have just lost all my designer configs. Just "poof" and they're gone. It appears as though I deleted my Panel... but I didn't... and certainly didn't click "Yes"... and closed the window to re-open when it seemed to have disappeared (without doing a controller "save") but I dare not sync the controller. </p>

<p>I probably pulled a zip sometime back... but I don't see anyway to restore it even if I have it.</p>

<p>HELP!!!!</p>

<p>Spent a couple of hours figuring out some panels to control my Nexa dimmers.  Next time i went into the designer, all the panels changes had gone. Like the entire session was lost. I use a number of PC's and I guess that the session logic in the web platform can;t cope.</p>

<p>Shame, as this kind of problem can REALLY put you off using something, and much of what's here looks very appealing.</p></font>
