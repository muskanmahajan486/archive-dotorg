				    <p>Have anyone thought about using the D-Link DNS-323 or DNS-343 as alternate hardware for running OpenRemote?</p>


<p>The D-Link DNS-323/343 is a ARM-based NAS that runs Linux (2.6 kernel) with a huge hacker community&#42; &#45;&#45; check out the first hacker wiki below for specs.</p>

<p>The DNS-323 is a two-drive NAS with 64 MB of RAM while the DNS-343 is a 4-drive NAS with 128 MB of RAM.&nbsp; These two devices connect to a LAN via a Gigabit Ethernet port.&nbsp; Furthermore, a USB port can be used/hacked for expadability (e.g., USB Hub for multiple devices, ZigBee USB Dongle, UPS Power Supply, Printer, CF Memory Stick, etc.).</p>


<p>My thought is that by running my home automation software on either of these devices, I'll be able to save a tremendous amount of money in energy costs by the mere fact that these devices idle at &lt;10 watts and use &lt;20 watts when the CPU is active, which is presumably less than other hardware solutions.&nbsp; Of course, when reading and writing to the hard drives, the energy consumption jumps to between 30 and 40 watts for the DNS-323 and 50 and 60 watts for the DNS-343 &#45;&#45; both of which are still extremely low amounts of energy.&nbsp; In order to minimize the affects of the hard drives (to keep energy consumption down), a USB memory stick can be used for temp, log, application and configuration files while leaving the hard drives just for large backup activities like Time Machine on my Mac or the backup software on my PC.</p>

<p>I happen to have one (1) DNS-323 and two (2) DNS-343's at my house.&nbsp; I have a wonderful backup and media server setup in place with these units, but would love to take them to the next step by running home automation software on one of them.</p>

<p>Haven't heard about anyone doing it yet. Would be interested to know how your experience is if you decide to give it a try. Especially curious about the Java VM performance on that platform.</p>

<p>Regarding energy use, if you check out our <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/OpenRemote+Reference+Implementation+-+Hardware+Bill+of+Materials" title="OpenRemote Reference Implementation - Hardware Bill of Materials">ALIX-based reference implementation</a> it is spec'ed at ~3W at idle, ~5W peak on the mainboard. Should note though that this does not include the power drawn by any USB devices connected to it, or WiFi PCI card transmitting. Not having a hard drive (CF card storage) is a benefit wrt. energy use and maintenance (no moving parts), especially when you move out of homes into building automation. The CPU is AMD Geode @500Mhz.</p>

<p>The Asus B202 is maybe closer as a comparison point as it also comes with a HDD. Their energy use is spec'ed higher IIRC although they still do quite a nice job with Intel's Atom as a low-energy PC. Especially considering the $300 price range. Mine is usually running for days without any noise coming from the fan and stays cool on idle.</p>

<p>Let us know if you make progress with the D-Link hardware. Would like to share documentation on it on the wiki.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
