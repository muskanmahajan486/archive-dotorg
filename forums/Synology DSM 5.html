				    <p>Hi all, <br/>
The new DSM v5 is out now. Does anybody know if OpenRemote is compatible with this new version? I'd like to update my 213j but I don't want to break up my OpenRemote configuration. It seems that in case of problems we can't downgrade to DSM 4.3...<br/>
Thanks</p>

I did notice that quite a bit of the extended functionality only applies to the x86 platform. For example their new <a href="http://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/app_packages/JavaManager">Java manager</a>.</p></font>

I found I needed to re-install the Java version (6) using Patters method found elsewhere on here. I had hoped to use the built-in Synology JAVA manager but it seemed to only want to install JRE 7.. I didn't spend too much time with it to be honest,  I just reverted back to what I knew worked for me.</p>

<p>Anyways, seems fine so far, no issues. Rules working etc.</p>

<p>Aside from OR, they upgraded their standard Database to MariaDB and changed to PHP 5.5. I had a lot of integration done in DSM 4.3 between Open Remote, MySQL the previous version of php. Took me a while to re-configure to cater for this (no fault of OR). Had I realised I would need to do this I think I wouldn't have bothered!..

I'm using OR and the DSM 5 since it's beta version without issue.<br/>
To achieve that, I'm running on the jdk7 installed through the syno java manager but I patched the drools engine with its "java7" patch found on the net.<br/>
Yesterday, I've updated to the DSM 5 release, reinstalled jdk7u51 and it's still working fine<br/>

<p>This will probably keep me a long time before upgrading to DSM5. On Patters forum I see also that there is fighting to get CrashPlan to work correctly. I'm quite reluctant to loose all my backups and start over again. </p>

<p>Depends on your machine. See <a href="http://www.synology.com/en-global/support/download">http://www.synology.com/en-global/support/download</a> the release note for your specific model.<br/>
It is important to keep your machine up to date. (Release 4.x was last updated on 2014-03-11. October 2013, Synology even provided a patch for my seven year old DS207+ !)</p></font>
