				    <p>It seems that OpenRemote is spending a lot of the system resources on polling. The HTTP protocol by its nature typically has very short polling intervals in order to improve responsiveness of the controlled devices. I have seen polling examples of one or two seconds or even less. For light switches which mostly are operated only in terms of hours, this is quite wasteful. Indeed if switched on via a panel a response in the order of a second is highly desirable. But if the switch is manually operated or falls off automatically, at least for me a feedback after half a minute or so is quite acceptable.</p>

<p>I am presently experimenting with Z-Wave switches operated via Razberry using the HTTP protocol. The switch on/off commands do return a null value. As I can control the Razberry side of the command I can return the actual status value. Unfortunately the HTTP call is unware of device it is controlling, so it can not pass this value on (afaik).</p>

<p>From my perspective of a user of the protocol it would be nice if the HTTP protocol had an attribute where I could select a sensor which would be immediately updated with the returned value of the on/off or any other command.</p>

<p><em>Does this line of thinking make sense as a generic solution?</em></p>

<p>(Sorry, I am not a programmer so I can't do a test implementation within the OR framework)<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Following the <b>ORCJAVA-337</b> suggestion it may occur that a sensor is being updated from multiple http calls. <br/>
At least that is how I read it. If the sensor update remains restricted to only one command, it would not really help solve my problem. That is updating a sensor directly from a http command, as well as using a separate http call for updating its status in a polling loop.</p>

<p>So maybe a better, more generic approach seems to allow the selection of multiple commands to update a single sensor.</p>

<p>Or rephrased in terms of using Designer, the idea is:</p>

<p>1) Make a command that polls the status of a device every so many minutes.<br/>
2) Make the command that switches a device on/off also return the the status value of that device.<br/>
3) Make a sensor where you can select both commands 1) and 2).</p>


<p>Would also be easier to maintain as well.<br/>
Thoughts?   </p>

<p><b>edit1:</b> I am aware that a sensor based on http requires it to have a polling interval set. (Some other protocols don't) For an on/off switch command, polling seems a not so good idea <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>From discussions with Marcus I got the impression that the shell execution command was a first example of how you guys intended to continue with the other 'standard' commands. I was not aware of the distinction in the OR concept of protocols dedicated to automation, and protocols not dedicated to automation. <br/>
I agree with you that a wild proliferation of functions on these protocols should be avoided, on the other hand commands and sensors bound to each other in the OR model. For a binary switch, the existence of a binary status is a necessary criterion. So the 'opportunistic' update of a sensor from these commands imho is not that way out.</p>

<p>That being said I am curious about more detail on how you see me combine requests in other ways. If that means that for example in the RaZberry application I have to continue to rely on polling, the RaZ-OR would scale badly.<br/>
So please enligthen me.<br/>
