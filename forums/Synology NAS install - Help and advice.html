				    <p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I have just registered and this is my first post. </p>

<p>I am currently attempting to install/use openremote on my Synology NAS and would like to get a little bit of help and advice if possible. I'll give a brief run down of me and what I am aiming for.</p>

<p>I am a intermediate computer Techy and self confessed geek. I previously installed a pre-package of openremote and gave the free designer a bash.</p>

<p>Now I have purchased the OpenRemote professional license and want to get the pro version of the controller installed. </p>

<p>Synology DS1315+<br/>
DSM 5</p>

<p>Packages:<br/>
Java manager <br/>
Apache Tomcat</p>

<p>Tomcat info:</p>

<p>Tomcat Version 	        JVM Version 	JVM Vendor 	        OS Name 	OS Version 	OS Architecture<br/>
Apache Tomcat/6.0.39 	1.7.0_51-b13 	Oracle Corporation 	Linux 	        3.2.40 	        i386</p>


<p>Install Files:<br/>
OpenRemote-Controller-Pro1.0.12 (sat on my desktop at present)</p>

<p>So..<br/>
I have Tomcat installed/setup and running.<br/>
I have java installed/setup and running.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me on what I need to do next to get this running. I would normally poke and prod around until I cracked it but I have just run out of steam and brain space. I would like to, just for once ask the right questions and get it running first time <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Thanks <br/>
Max</p>

<p>I am not sure if that post also covers the setting of port 8688, which is typical for the Pro version</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Pieter,</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. I have already browsed through the article and unfortunately it doesn't seem to quite work out for me. What caught my eye was this:</p>

<p>"There is one other possible method of installing OR, without the patters package, by using the stock Synology Tomcat and Java packages. I haven't tried this myself yet, but maybe someone could do a step-by-step guide using that method?"</p>

<p>So I was rather hoping someone could assist with how I would go about deploying a directory and WAR on tomcat. I am going to start picking away at it and see how I get on. If I get anywhere ill update my post.</p>

<p>Thanks<br/>
Max</p></font>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply and offer your help. However I really want to do this all myself, its more of a "dog with a bone" I just don't want to drop it. </p>

<p>Simply put I want to understand how to add OpenRemote so that If I want to move/change/update/downgrade I can do this myself instead of relying on others to do it for me. Kinda sounds stupid in a way but I just cant let it go now. </p>

<p>So if you or anyone else knows and can point me in the right direction, I will do the rest. If not I will find out and report back when Ive cracked it; with a full write up on how I did it of course <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Thanks </p></font>

<p>So I have got somewhere. If someone could help me figure this last bit out would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Installed Java Manager<br/>
Installed Java SE 7 55<br/>
Installed Tomcat7</p>

<p>Edited the tomcat-users.xml and added a administrator account.</p>

<p>Downloaded OpenRemote Pro from online designer.<br/>
Unzipped OpenRemote Pro to /volume1/Data<br/>
Copied contents of the webapps folder to /volume1/@appstore/Tomcat7/src/webapps/</p>

<p>Logged onto the Tomcat app manager to check the deployments had worked</p>

<p>browsed to synologyip:7070/controller/<br/>
Entered in my pro username and password<br/>
Presented with below error:</p>

<p>The path 'file:/../webapps/controller' doesnt exist.</p>

<p>I would add a log file there are a few with allot of errors. So if there's one in particular let me know. I have managed to work out this its possibly a permissions issue however how I remedy this situation I don't know.</p></font>
