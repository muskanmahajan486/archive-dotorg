				    <p>Hi.</p>

<p>I have a number of z-wave devices working now (soon I will NEED my pro license!!)</p>

<p>The latest addition to my network is a Horstmann room thermostat and central heating controller: <a href="http://www.horstmann.co.uk/central-heating.php#CentaurPlusZW">http://www.horstmann.co.uk/central-heating.php#CentaurPlusZW</a></p>

<p>In general it is working with OR. I can change the threshold temperature on the thermostat and I can manually turn the boiler on and off using a switch however I do have a few issues that I guess are due to the implementation of z-wave in OR? All of these work fine in z-wave.me</p>

<p>The Thermostat returns both the threshold temperature AND the current room temperature however I can't seem to find a way to get the current temperature in OR? The temp command returns only the threshold temperature and status command always returns null (I think this is battery low though). In z-wave.me it provides both a thermostat and a sensor device (the sensor contains the current room temp).</p>

<p>Also the boiler controller is a switch. It doesn't seem to automatically return the current status when it is changed. This happens in z-wave.me as well but z-wave me has an "Update" button which does successfully get the current status of the switch.</p>

<p>While this is working well enough for me to "play" with, it means that any automation of the heating that I can do is limited as I have no way of telling the current temperature or whether the boiler is currently on or not? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Phil</p>

Pieter is right and our impl currently does not support read temp out of the thermostat since my Danfoss, which I used to test, does not support this.<br/>
Currently I am implementing native support for the "MicasaVerde Vera" which is a network Z-Wave gateway and this works already quite well.<br/>
The advantage is that we don't need to program the native z-wave serial prtotocol which is quite complex.<br/>
I prefer the use of Vera or Razperry (which we will support one day also).<br/>

I am specifically interested in Danfoss Living Connect. The present thermostat implementation does not go well with DLC. For some reason it can't always send the device back to sleep. As a result I observed heavy drain on batteries. The behaviour is not precisely predictable, but did occur within a day in all my experiments.<br/>
As Marcus said Z-Wave is not trivial to implement.<br/>

<p>Given the feedback I've received in private, let me clarify one point about this thread:</p>

<p>We will continue to develop our native Z-wave implementation in OpenRemote, and our goal is to extend it further. Phil Taylor already expressed interest in integrating his Z-Wave devices, if there are other contributors who want to continue developing the Z-wave stack, let us know (access will be limited given the Z-wave licensing restrictions).</p>
