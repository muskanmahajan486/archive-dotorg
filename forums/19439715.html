				    <p>Hi.<br/>
totally new to Openremote and like the first impression alot... been looking for a solution for android and web for some time ...</p>

<p>i am running Housebot, some xAP apps and xAP hardware. i would like to connect openremote to my system... (HB have remotes for windows and windows mobile exclusive)<br/>
atleast 2 alternatives:<br/>
1. Openremote to Housebot - housebot have a ASCII IP connection called External Control. Able to set state of Devices and properties in HB, run tasks, get lists of devices, properties and modes, request status of properties... this means that some polling need to be done to get device status but setting devies with openremote telnet is already done... <br/>
2. Openremote to xAP - xAP is nice but in some way complex and undefined... an basic implementation of BSC with info,command and event would be feasable but how would a suggestion to do that? is any plan for xAP in the scope? (commands from buttons and indicators would indicate info and event msg) </p>

<p>any other view on how to use Openremote?</p>

<p>kind regs </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>(1) should get you started quickly, at least up to sending some basic commands</p>

<p>(2) xAP has been mentioned since the start of OR project but there has been very limited actual demand for it. As usual, we provide an integration platform and can host xAP protocol implementation (just like any other protocol implementation) if someone contributes the protocol code.</p>

<p>Are you a programmer, can you contribute? The core team at the moment is fairly busy with the framework itself so we have limited capability to focus on specific protocol details (our goal is to develop the framework further to make it easier for community to contribute).</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>1) is already done <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> works! but only as a remote , one way... would like to show status and values too... is it possible to set up som polling mechanism based on what "properties is shown on any screen or do i need to poll all properties at all times?</p>

<p>2) i guess this is a good strategy... i am not a programmer... but we are a little group of happy house automation entusiasts here in sweden (some programmers <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> ) that would like to look in to the possibilities to do a basic xAP protocol implementation that suits our needs.. we will not go into any wrestling about how much xAP it is <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> . kan you point us in the right direction how to start... and documentation or examples...</p></font>

<p>For devices that actively broadcast their status information, you can implement an <a href="https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/tags/project/Controller/Controller_2_0_0/src/org/openremote/controller/protocol/EventListener.java">EventListener</a> interface. There's no documentation for it yet beyond the Javadoc included in the source. You will need to implement a thread listening to the incoming data yourself and then push the values into the controller's state cache (using the sensor reference as shown in the example).</p>

<p>I expect some slight API changes to occur on this interface still but if you plan to contribute your implementation back to the OpenRemote project, I can probably deal with them myself as part of the regular maintenance cycle.</p>
