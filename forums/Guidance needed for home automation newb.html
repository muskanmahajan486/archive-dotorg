				    <p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>First an introduction of myself:<br/>
My name is Doug Slattery and I am a software professional with an electronics background.  I'm comfortable in both Windows &amp; Linux environments with high &amp; low level dev experience on both platforms in multiple languages including C/C++, Assembly and Java.  I've also got the front end experience in the Windows API, X-Windows and Web design.  Not to mention multiple scripting languages.</p>

<p>I've thought about getting into home automation for some time now, and my wife is expanding her business and we've decided to throw automation into it, so here I am.  I've been doing a bunch of reading over the past few days on different hardware &amp; software products to the point where things are starting to mesh into a big blob of oatmeal in my head. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Ok, so the goal for my wife's business benefited by some home prototyping will be to have multi-room climate control, lighting control, audio/video including text to speech + voice recognition.  Throw in some security with electronic deadbolts, video surveillance, remote monitoring/alerting.  ... and probably some things that would be cool to throw in along the way.</p>

<p>A tall order? probably.  I'm not looking to do it overnight &amp; have a few months to get some basic functionality of each area working.  Some of the posts I've read are starting to get dated as in older than 1 year now &amp; I'd appreciate some feedback from what is currently out there and the direction the industry is headed.</p>

<p>From what I've seen it looks like Arduino and Raspberry Pi are preferred hardware components to the community &amp; are well supported.  My observation is that Arduino is more appropriate for sensors, motor control and things of that nature where Raspberry is more appropriate for audio/video, although I briefly read about an audio add on board for Arduino.</p>

<p>Anyone care to share their preferences as it will apply to me?</p>

<p>Then there is z-wave.  I'm getting hung up on the licensing issues and difficulty there seems to be creating a robust application with the protocol.  It seems professional looking electronic deadbolts (Kwikset, Schlage, Baldwin) use z-wave.  What's the scoop with z-wave and OR?  Can I purchase their SDK and implement it with OR and still be part of the community, or do I need to go to the dark side &amp; sign a contractor agreement with OR?  I would prefer to stay with the community if possible.</p>

<p>Then again, if there is a viable professionally looking deadbolt alternative, I'm open to that too.</p>

<p>Ok, I've rattled enough for one sitting.  I look forward to your comments.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Good morning Doug,</p>

<p>May I ask if you're looking for DIY solutions to your business goals or are you in need of professional solutions?</p>

<p>If you'd be kind enough to hunt down my web site and email address, I'd be happy to discuss the merits of a Velbus system that could meet the majority of your requirements at a hardware level, with OpenRemote providing a flexible and powerful user interface.</p>

<p>Best wishes and good luck,</p>

<p>For everyone else, I didn't mention I'm in the US, near Dallas Texas, so hardware needs to be available in the US.</p>
