				    <p>Trying to access the designer, I get "500 The call failed on the server; see server log for details" when I use firefox and I can't see my devices.  When I use IE, I don't get the error and I can see my devices, but I can't see some on my panels.  </p>

<p>Now this is where I get lost.  If I use another computer with firefox or IE, it works fine.  Nothing has changed on my computer.  If it is my browser, how can I fix it?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I had the same issue but I have solved it. Eventually I switched to Google Chrome which gave me the ability to work fine.<br/>
Then I have to check all device definitions to remove characters like &amp;, / etc. The is one post the talks about &amp; sign under XML so I figured out the cleaning will do the job. This is what happned.<br/>
Remember to use only non IE as I have experinced situation the re-opening with IE re-enabled the undesired characters.<br/>
Once it is OK, no need to refresh new design as it is being synced automatically.</p>

<p>Hope it solves thigs for you.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Mike,</p>

<p>When using the Designer, under Building Modeler, you are expected to creat devices, Sensors etc. Just verify that the names do not incluse characters like &amp;, / etc. These are used by XML and special characters and as far as I understand, the XML code becomes broken.<br/>
It started for me under IE9. I have moved to Chrome, managed to clean all names and now it works great on my Android Tablet and smart phones. Still need to add IiPad and iPhones as well but I see no issue as the devices are all in place (I have about a 100 of them).</p>

<p>Hope you understand.</p>

I just can't access the designer through firefox on one computer.  I think it's my computer, but I don't know what to clean and/or fix to make it work again.  I just recently cleaned out my history and cookies, but I don't know how that could of broke it.  Any ideas would be helpful.</p>
