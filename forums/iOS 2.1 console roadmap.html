				    <p>As I did start work on the next version of the iOS console, I just wanted to let people know the plan and give everybody a chance to provide feedback as soon as possible.<br/>
The main goals for this 2.1 release are:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>have a universal iPhone/ iPod touch / iPad app</li>
	<li>review the whole startup experience and the settings screen</li>
	<li>fix the reported issue on the UI display</li>
	<li>a lot of code cleaning under the hood</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="iOS2.1consoleroadmap-Settingsscreenreview"></a>Settings screen review</h4>

<p>The Settings screen now displays a list of all the known controllers. Whether they are manually entered or auto-discovered does not matter, they're all in the same list.<br/>
When you arrive on the Settings screen, the iOS application tries to contact each of the know controller.<br/>
It does this by contacting the controller at the "main" URL (the one you entered or that got discovered) and asking for the round-robin group members.<br/>
As it contacts them, it'll display a status icon on the right:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>spinning "activity" indicator while trying</li>
	<li>a green dash if connection was OK</li>
	<li>a red circle if connection was not possible</li>
	<li>a lock if connection was possible but an authentication was required and either the username/password the console knows about are incorrect or the console does not have any (at this stage, it does not request the credentials to the user)</li>
</ul>


<p>If you click on the detail disclosure indicator, a page with all the details on this controller is displayed.<br/>
From there you can see (and edit) the main controller URL, see a list of the round-robin group members (if connection was possible).<br/>
The credentials are also displayed (not the password) and editable.<br/>
As soon as you change any of the editable value, a connection to that specific controller, with the newly entered value, is tried.</p>

<p>When you return to the settings page, connection to all the known controllers is tried again.</p>

<p>When you select a given controller, connection to it is tried again. If credentials are required at this stage, a pop-up requests the username/password to the user.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>That looks good.<br/>
Once you enter the credentials for a controller that needs authentication, will those be saved? If yes, how can you change the credentials?<br/>
Let's say more familiy member use the device and once I am done I don't want my son use the same credentials.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Yes, credentials are saved.<br/>
The logout action that you can assign to a button in the modeler is supposed to forget those I think. I'll need to double check that.<br/>
Anyway, the details of the credentials (well username, pwd won't be displayed in clear text) will be displayed on the detail page for a controller. There I can also add a button the forget credentials.</p></font>

If you did send me your UDID in the past, then just shout here and I'll create a build for you.<br/>
Otherwise, please send an e-mail to eric [ at ] openremote [ dot ] org with your device UDID.</p></font>

Available as an update to the existing 2.0 iPad console. But will now work on both iPad and iPhone.<br/>
If you had the older iPhone only version, you need to download the new application though.</p>

<p>Please do post any issue we're seeing with this version here on the forum.<br/>
Even though the UI and functionality has not changed a lot in this release, a lot has changed behind the scenes.<br/>
We should now be able to push a 2.2 with bug fixes and improvements a lot faster.</p></font>
