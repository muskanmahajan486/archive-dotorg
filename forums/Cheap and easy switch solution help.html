				    <p>Hi OR community some advice needed please!</p>

<p>I have OR up and running nicely with Lighting/Music using DSC, Sonos, Legrand and a few other devices.  Very impressed with the tool.</p>

<p>Next challenge - I have a swimming pool which is about 20 meters from the house with a machine room which has its own wiring including a lighting circuit for the pool.  I want to automate the pool lighting using a wireless link.  What would be the cheapest way of setting this up with OR.   I guess I have to choose between Z-wave, En-ocean etc.  Range will be fairly important - at the moment my wifi does not reach as far as the pool so would need improve on that.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>From my experience both Z-wave and EnOcean have worse range than WiFi. The worst is Z-wave (very sensitive for computer generated noise) with EnOcean in between. You would need some dedicated bridge to cover this 20m to your pool. WiFi offers solutions which I usually use on my holidays (easy picks signal from 100 meters) <a href="http://hawkingtech.com/long-range-wifi-solutions/index.html">http://hawkingtech.com/long-range-wifi-solutions/index.html</a><br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Well, my technology of choice is EnOcean and the actuator which I love is FSVA-230V (<a href="http://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/datasheets/Wireless_datasheet_FSVA-230V.pdf">http://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/datasheets/Wireless_datasheet_FSVA-230V.pdf</a>)<br/>
It has beside a switch a power meeter and repeater. You can try to reach your pool with EnOcean repeaters, but IMHO with wifi it would be easier task. It is hard to say remotely without testing on site. 20m for wifi should be no problem, especially 11n or 11ac. As wifi is a more widely used technology than any other wireless (EnOcean, Zigbee or Z-wave, etc), using it for range extension will be cheaper for sure.  </p></font>

You would connect the wifi actuator to your network via wifi (assuming you have a wifi network). I would assume your open remote controller runs on your network. so your open remote controller should be able to connect to the actuator (test this using ping).</p>

<p>It looks like the enocean setup for openremote is in the forums:

<p>I'm looking for the same thing, except a 3 way light switch.</p>

<p>Buying gateways seems to me to be counter to the desired end goal. </p>

<p>In my industry (High availability data acquisition across WANs), we call these gateway devices FEPs (Front end processors). They are problematic because it is another device 'in the middle' which can go wrong and troubleshoot. And if they are store and forward types, and not routing, this means you can receive 'old' data.</p>

<p>I like how OR has connected to irtrans(which I have), directly to the device.</p>

<p>Of course if manufacturers use proprietary protocols beyond their gateways, talking directly to the device is more difficult, and requires reverse engineering of the packet between the gateway and the end device.</p>

<p>so maybe the belkin above can be connected to by OR http commands?</p></font>

Also pretty expensive if you are going to buy more than one or two.  I was hoping to find something around €30 or less.  Given they can build a Raspberry pi for this you'd have thought it would be possible!  </p>

<p>I agree on the Itrans I've got that working nicely too.  I've also got a gateway for lighting from Legrand so I'm trying to avoid yet another one.  Legrand has a zigbee api but crazy prices and the range apparently not too great.   </p>

<p>Ultimately I think if you are going to have a reasonable number of lights then a gateway makes sense, mine from Legrand is rock solid and bounces back up in seconds after a powercut.  Whereas my openremote platform is at least 2 minutes to boot and being windows based can fall over.  </p>

<p>Wireshark is the hardcore way. Google in my case is enough, just few minutes gives this <a href="https://github.com/ericblue/Perl-Belkin-WeMo-API">https://github.com/ericblue/Perl-Belkin-WeMo-API</a>, <a href="http://developers.belkin.com/wemo/sdk">http://developers.belkin.com/wemo/sdk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/issackelly/wemo">https://github.com/issackelly/wemo</a>, etc.<br/>
Quite few interesting links.<br/>
Unfortunately, because WeMo uses SOAPACTION header it is not 'yet' possible to drive them directly from OR through the HTTP protocol. However, with command line protocol sky is the limit. The first link contains a shell script how to switch WeMo with wget or curl commands. I've tested the curl example and it works for with my Belkin devices.</p></font>

At the moment I can turn the switch on/off from command line, so it can be uses from OR with the shell protocol. The status reading must be possible too. I'll investigate it too.<br/>
The range depends on your WiFi setup. For sure it will be much larger than any EnOcean or Z-wave solution. And with the range extenders available for WiFi it can be easily up to km range.</p></font>

<p>For some funny reason my Z-wave goes much further than my Wifi (Fritzbox7170). This longer distance of Z-Wave is mostly due to the mesh architecture. The single Z-Wave hops are indeed shorter. That distance only matters if I have to include a new device. If I have to I just take my RaZberry closer to the device. Z-Wave tends to operate much better if you have more (permanently powered) devices. I have 15 at the moment.<br/>
The RF signal of my Somfy remote for the sunscreens do even better than the other two.</p>

<p>PS: Read about the IFTTT. Interesting. Agree on the hype potential. </p></font>

<p>This indeed is the case of HA network. However, if you want to bridge a longer distance without any device in between (this is what originally Jules want to do), then WiFi seems to offer the cheapest and most robust solution. Next step is to use WiFi sensor and actor.</p>

<p>Jules, BTW, the python code from my last link <a href="https://github.com/issackelly/wemo">https://github.com/issackelly/wemo</a> has a possibility to read the switch status.</p></font>
