				    <p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>i'm trying to setup a system with a Elexol Ether IO72 card, a very flexible and nice piece of hardware because it has 9 port, each one with 8 bits for a total of 72 programmable I/O bits which, with an additional A/D converter, can also accept analog signals.<br/>
My problem is that the card sends back the port status as hex which, once converted to binary, i get the 1 or 0 status of each bit.</p>

<p>Just to make clear, if i send the command a to get the status of port A what i get back is "41 1f" where <br/>
41=A in hex<br/>
1f once converted in binary = 00011111 that means that the first 3 bits are 0, the last 5 are 1</p>

<p>analogue example can be made with any number at 8 digit binary </p>

<p>Now the questions.... how can i convert the hex to decimal and read a specific bit inside the 8 digit binary number in order to get the status of that specific bit?? </p>

<p>Is it possible to create a regular expression??</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you would like to give.</p>

<p>Costa</p>
