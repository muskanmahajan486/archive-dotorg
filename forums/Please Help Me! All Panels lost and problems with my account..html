				    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Today i made a Controller change from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0.<br/>
It works nice but i had a problem with the sync Function.<br/>
Allways i get the error that my username and password is not correct! But i'm sure that the password and the user is correct.</p>

<p>Then i tryed the fix with to make a new panel in the designer and download it as zip file.<br/>
After it i get the same Error as before.</p>

<p>Then i opened my OpenRemote preview Designer and all panels are lost............ Fu...</p>

<p>I hope you can help me to get back all my panels in my Account.<br/>
I have a zip File downloaded before the problem occours.</p>

<p>At an other Pc now i have an additional problem - I can't log in to the preview designer: 500 the call failed on the server; see server log for details.</p>

<p>regards GÃ¼nther</p>
