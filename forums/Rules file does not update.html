				    <p>I change the modeler_rules.drl to debug my code.<br/>
I see the file was updated in the server but when I sync the project with my server the file does not change.<br/>
Even if I erase the file in the my server the original file is rewritten (the one before the changes).<br/>
It iuse to happen two weeks ago, then it stopped. Now its back again.</p>

<p>Need help!!!!!</p>

Sometimes the text entered into the textarea in the designer is not saved (the textarea has to loose focuse before hitting save).<br/>
Also, your design has to be saved before syncing. Make sure to hit save in the toolbar and wait for the info box that it was saved. Then you can redeploy.</p>

<p>We have seen some issues but were not able to reproduce yet, where the file was not updated on the controller after a deploy.</p></font>

Further more, one of the panel screens was gone. Its name is in Hebrew so that might be the issue. This is the 2nd time it happened.<br/>
I will try to follow your instructions and see.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></font>
