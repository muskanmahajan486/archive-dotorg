				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have posted this over on <a href="http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?4157-OpenRemote-as-a-complete-controller-solution">automatedhomes.co.uk</a>, but I guess the lack of response suggests it's the wrong forum, so I'm trying here.</p>

<p>I would quite like to set up OpenRemote for Z-Wave, connected to my QNAP, OpenRemote state I need "<a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Z-Wave">Aeon Z-Stick Series 2</a>". Does that mean I don't need to buy a controller such as the <a href="http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-fibaro-home-center-2-system">Fibaro Home Center 2</a> / <a href="http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-fibaro-home-center-lite">Home Center Lite</a>?</p>

<p>Is there any disadvantage to going down the OpenRemote route? I do see there is a limit to 10 devices with the Free OpenRemote solution. The "Professional" license of OpenRemote is 150 Euros, and the hardware costs seem to be a fraction. Aeon Z-Stick = £41.00 v. Home Center 2 / lite £497 / £250. </p>

<p>This massive price difference makes me think I'm not getting something.</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>W. </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Rainer,</p>

<p>Many thanks for your reply.</p>

<p>Good to know about the device limit, but is one limited to the level of customisation available with only the free version?</p>

<p>To start with, I'd like to control the lighting in our entrance hall. There're 5 doors leading off the hall, but only one light switch! To achieve this, I intend to get a  <a href="http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-fibaro-universal-dimmer">Fibaro FGD211 dimmer module</a> and connect it up to 1 dimmer and 4 momentary switches, as shown:</p>

<p><img src="attachments/23596916/23789804.png" align="left" border="0"/><br/>
<a href="http://www.vesternet.com/resources/application-notes/apnt-2#.VPZCgPmsVQ1">http://www.vesternet.com/resources/application-notes/apnt-2#.VPZCgPmsVQ1</a></p>

<p>To achieve this, I plan to:<br/>
1. Replace the existing single switch with a dimmer switch and installing the FGD211 behind.<br/>
2. Installing new momentary switches in the right places. <br/>
3. Running 1.0mm2 T&amp;E cable from the FGD211 (S1 to COM, Sx to L1) for each momentary switch in a radial circuit.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to have the hall lights come on when the front door is opened:<br/>
4. Install the Fibaro Door &amp; Window sensor on the front door.<br/>
5. Programme to activate the hall lights.</p>

<p>Finally, have a table lamp come on at dusk and switch off at a set time.<br/>
6. Install the <a href="http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-fibaro-relay-insert-2-1-5kw">Fibaro 2x 1.5 kW relay</a> in a 2-Gang 13A socket to control the table lamp<br/>
7. Install the <a href="http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-philio-multisensor-pir-light-temp-gen5">Philio PSP01</a> (Light level sensor + PIR + Temp) or <a href="http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-fibaro-motion-sensor">Fibaro motion sensor</a><br/>
8. Programme the table lamp to come on at a given LUX level and turn off at a set time.</p>

<p>All this should be controllable via the Aeon Z-stick 2, connected to a QNAP storage device, running OpenRemote. Of course, all this can be controlled via an Android mobile device, through the OpenRemote App.</p>

<p>If this works according to plan, I hope to add additional sensors / switches to control outside lighting and other electrical devices.</p>

<p>Do you think this is achievable with OpenRemote and the Z-Stick, or will this require a more traditional controller?</p>

<p>Many thanks for your help.</p>

<p>W.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Your initial list of Fibaro devices (<b>Fibaro Universal Dimmer 500W FGD-211</b>, <b>Fibaro Double Relay Switch FGS-221</b>, <b>Fibaro Door/Window Sensor FGK 101-107</b>, <b>Fibaro Motion Sensor FGMS-001</b>) are very well supported. It's even possible to configure a multi instance association in order to address the second channel of the <b>Fibaro Double Relay Switch FGS-221</b> from a Z-Wave device that supports the Z-Wave <em>COMMAND_CLASS_MULTI_CHANNEL_ASSOCIATION</em> (e.g. turn on the light that is connected to the second channel of the <b>Fibaro Double Relay Switch FGS-221</b> if <b>Fibaro Motion Sensor FGMS-001</b> detects motion). </p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure about the Philio sensor because we've never tested it but it shouldn't be a problem because the Z-Wave <em>COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL</em> has already been implemented.</p>

<p>I think that your lighting installation is achievable with OpenRemote. I don't see any particular Z-Wave problems and the rest is standard OpenRemote stuff (rules).</p></font>
