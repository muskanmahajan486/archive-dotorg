				    <p>Hi all, </p>

<p>I have a faulty Bus coupler that has the wrong manufacturer ID. Says, product is company A , but when i try to get the device info, it says the manufacturer is company B. So basically the bus coupler is useless. </p>

<p>But now i would like to fix it. From the knowledge base in OpenRemote, i have come to know that how to send a cEMI code to via a tunnelling_request. So my question now is, is it possible to change the value of the manufacturer ID in that bus coupler? </p>

<p>In my opinion i thought that it can be change, since the manufacturer ID of the device is represent by a value says (from the ETS4 software , reading the device info): </p>

<p>Busch : 7 ( manufacturer ID for KNX)<br/>
ABB: 2     (manufacturer ID for KNX)</p>

<p>My device is a Busch device but it always read 2 . So how can i change the value 2 to 7 so that it works again. </p>

<p>I appreciate much if anyone could point me to the correct direction. </p>

<p>So far, i was able to turn on the light bulb using tunneling_request via  KNXIP-router in Visual Basic code format. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>Best regards, </p>

<p>Anthony</p>
