				    <p>My name is Mike</p>

<p>I'm a complete nood to OR/home automation, I installed OR on an XP box and would like to interface with Z-Wave devices.  what is the best controller to get?</p>


<p>My ultimate goal is to used my Raspberry Pi with the z-wave GPIO daughter board.</p>



<p>Thanks you in advance.</p>

<p>but I'm going to start out with XP just to familiarize myself with the interface and UI design...<br/>
is the Aeon DSA02203-ZWUS Labs Z-Wave Z-Stick Series 2 USB Dongle a good dongle?  </p>

The stick is NOT compatible with the RaZberry Software that runs on the Raspberry Pi. That software comes licensed with the GPIO hardware device.</p>

<p>You may want to look in the pages of OpenRemote MicasaVerde Vera integration as well. There is a link to it in the Razberry page I described in my previous post. Vera is an formally supported product within OpenRemote. Razberry is not (yet?). Vera does have a built-in Z-Wave controller.</p>

<p>The most optimal control equipment depends very much on the ultimate size of your installation and the type of devices you intend to use.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks Juha.</p>

<p>In your opinion what would be better suited for my needs, I'm pretty technical and somewhat comfortable with coding.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi with the Z-wave GPIO daughter board<br/>
or <br/>
Aeon Labs Z-Stick 2</p>

<p>Again, I'm looking to keep cost down for now,but I really want to explore home automation. I also love to use OR to bring it all together.</p>


<p>Thanks again!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>It's a trade-off of different factors.</p>

<p>Razberry supports more devices. But it only works with Raspberry so you'll need to be comfortable with Linux. Raspberry is also on the low-end for the hardware, using bigger CPU gives faster startup times, faster loading times. Alternative is to install OR on separate PC instead of the Rpi + Razberry unit, and access it over HTTP.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Install+Controller+on+Raspberry+Pi" title="OpenRemote 2.0 How To - Install Controller on Raspberry Pi">OpenRemote 2.0 How To &#45; Install Controller on Raspberry Pi</a> for install instructions. Should give you a good indication what is required.</p>

<p>The use of HTTP for Razberry can be a bit limiting. HTTP is at heart a request-response protocol which doesn't sit well with sensor networks (which are more push than pull). </p>


<p>Z-Stick with OR currently limited to basic light control, dim, binary sensors, some limited thermostat functionality. Convenient since you can plug it into any USB port, Linux, Mac, Windows. And any kind of device, ebox, PC, laptop, etc. The serial API protocol is bi-directional so don't have HTTP related issues with polling. There's also some auto-import functionality of devices directly into the designer instead of having to manually enter them in, but currently only in the paid version of Designer. For free Designer, manually entering the Z-wave data is still needed.</p>


<p>Have not compared prices between the two. The above are the feature differences more or less. You can choose between cheap, complete and scalable &#8211; but you can only get 2 out of 3. Three out of three is still work in progress.</p>
