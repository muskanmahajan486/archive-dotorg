				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>with the new update it's not possible to backup or restore with Dropbox, I have the error:</p>

<p>Unable to login<br/>
Only the app owner can receive access token while this app is in developmentmode.</p>


<p>I have tried with differentes accounts and not success, I have checked Dropbox forums and this problem appears in several threads but, anyway, I can't backup OR.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

Now Apple was faster releasing the updated app than Dropbox allowing the app to access other accounts. I hope they will fix this the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Basically the switch from Google Docs to Dropbox was kind of necessary as the Google API is in some permanent "work in progress" state. The main problem was that new Google Doc accounts had different settings than older accounts and depending on these settings the XML files OR KNX uploaded to their servers were modified to the extend that they were no longer useable. With Dropbox that is not the case (beside being faster and needing less code).</p></font>
