				    <p>Dears,<br/>
I am working for a company doing business in the sector of home-automation. And we are starting to implement OpenRemote in our projects.<br/>
We have just finished a project with KNX for one of our clients. In order to control the project with his cell phones, we have bought the professional license OpenRemote KNX for iPhone 1.4.2.<br/>
The project already works perfectly on one of the cell phones. Since we have several cell phones and iTouch, we need to pass the project to these different devices.<br/>
In order to pass it to one of the others, we export the project-file  to GoogleDocs.  <br/>
When trying to import the project with one of the other devices, we can detect the project-file, but when it comes to download it, the OpenRemote shuts down.<br/>
Does anybody have a similar experience and/or can you suggest a solution?<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Best regards!</p>

<p>Google offers a new version of text editor. By default this is active for all newly uploaded documents. If you upload an XML file (as OR KNX does) as a plain text file, Google Docs imports this properly and also lets you edit it. If you try to download it however, you will always get the file as PDF regardless of the format you choose. OR KNX certainly cannot handle PDFs as import data and is kind of upset. You can however disable this new editor in Google Docs' settings (choose settings-&gt;editing and disable the checkbox on "Create new documents using the latest version of the document editor").</p>

<p>I will keep an eye on this, maybe it's only a couple of servers in Google's cloud. If the error should return, I will file a bug report for Google.</p></font>
