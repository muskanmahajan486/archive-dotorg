				    <p>I've been using OpenRemote for a few weeks now. I have Volume UP and DOWN configured for my receiver and "Repeat" to be able to hold the button. It works most of the time but sometimes (10%?), even when releasing the button, it goes into LOOP and keeps holding the button which means it keeps increasing the volume infinitely. I know the problem is the actual Panel since if I quit the app it stops (tried two different iPhone 3GS and one Android - all with same problem).</p>

<p>Anyone seen this?</p>

<p>Details. The Panels communicate with a MacMini (LAN) running Controller 2.0.0 (dev release 11). It communicates with an iTach WF2IR (Firmware 710-1001-04) over WiFi and sends commands over IP (port 4998) and the commands below I saved manually using their iLearn.exe utility. Whenever it goes into loop I see the WF2IR keeps sending the commands out on the port to the receiver and I see the IR-blaster keeps sending commands. If I power restart the WF2IR, it takes ~20s to reboot, but it keeps sending commands. The ONLY way to stop it is to kill the app on the Panel - then the commands stop. So that's why I suspect the panel.</p>

Interesting that both iOS and Android are showing the same issue. That it only occurs sometimes makes it a bit difficult to track down.</p>

<p>I'll push the report around to see if anyone recognizes the issue. Will keep an eye out on the implementation if anything obvious pops out.</p>

<p>If you manage to dig out further details, please do let us know.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Some time since I first reported this but it still happens and I at last spent some time troubleshooting it. As I mentioned before this is definitely the actual iPhone app since I can see the iTach keep outputting the signal (LED on the iTach shows it) over and over again even after releasing the button on the iPhone and if I quite the iPhone app - it stops.</p>

<p>The iPhone has been updated to 4.3.5 - still same problem.</p>

<p>One reason I suspect is that I have "Repeat" on the Volume UP and DOWN, but I don't think it's because of "Repeat" but rather the output command because I have Repeat on other buttons (like UP and DOWN for the Apple Remote for the MAC Mini) but it has never happen on these - only on Volume UP and DOWN.</p>

<p>So the difference might be in the actual SEND command which may cause the loop?</p>

<p>VOLUME DOWN/UP for Yamaha which causes loop sometimes:<br/>
