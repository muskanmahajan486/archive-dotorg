				    <p>A little over a month ago, I joined my colleagues at Open Software Integrators remotely for a presentation on ongoing OpenRemote work that we have been involved in.  One of the things that I have been thinking about most is using Inversion of Control through Dependency Injection to simplify the Android console as well as to make room for more flexibility.  The slides and a blurb about the presentation are here: <a href="http://osintegrators.com/AfterTriDroidMeetup_August_2011">http://osintegrators.com/AfterTriDroidMeetup_August_2011</a> .  An excellent article by SpringSource's Roy Clarkson on similar topics is here: <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/26/clean-code-with-android/">http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/26/clean-code-with-android/</a> .</p>

<p>The branch where the RoboGuice dependency injection work is taking place originally started out as a branch to clean up the client-side controller failover implementation.  I realized that the code to make HTTP connections to the controller was scattered all over the place, as was the code to implement failover.  I wanted one central location for the implementation of those features so that I could ensure a consistent implementation without more of my hairs' turning gray.  My colleague Yusha Vadlamudi is continuing this work.</p>

<p>The branch in question is located in the OpenRemote Subversion repository at workspace/andrewball/Android_Console_2_0_0_Betas_ANDROID_85_failover/ .</p>
