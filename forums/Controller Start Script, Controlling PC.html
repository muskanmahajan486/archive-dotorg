				    <p>Hello everyone! I recently purchased a Global Cache iTach WF2IR to control the devices in my apartment from my iPhone, and it has been working great! I'm enjoying figuring things out and designing all kinds of different panel setups and macros for my devices, but I do have a few questions that I'm hoping someone can help me with.</p>

<p>1) I'm looking for a way to start the OR controller as soon as my computer starts up. I've tried various ways of writing batch files to start the controller, but they all run the openremote file and then exit the command prompt right away, so the controller doesn't stay open. I've even tried using programs such as HStart, which had a 'wait' option, but the same issue occurred. Has a solution already been worked out for this? Or do we have to open the command line and run the file every time manually?</p>

<p>2) I'd like to be able to run a few macros from my computer itself using my phone as well (for example, switching the display output from my computer monitor to my TV). I can make desktop shortcuts or batch files that will do what I need, but how do I implement those in commands on the OR Designer? How can I set up my computer as another device that OR can control? Ideally I would just create a folder on my computer and put any batch files or short cuts or anything there, and then access those from the Designer, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.</p>

<p>I appreciate any assistance/advice anyone can provide!</p>

<p>are you running your controller on Linux or Windows? For Linux you will just have to link the "openremote.sh" script from tomcat/bin folder into /etc/init.d to have the controller start automatically. For windows it might be better if you use a standard tomcat installation which comes with an installer that creates the windows services which are needed to run java when starting windows. After that you just need to copy the controller.war file from tomcat/webapps folder into the new tomcat installation.</p>

<p>OpenRemote does not support running scripts on the controller invoked by commands. This is a good idea and we maybe you can create an issue in the OpenRemote jira (<a href="http://jira.openremote.org/">http://jira.openremote.org/</a>).</p>

<p>there is an open source program by the name of MCE controler which works with<br/>
Openremote.<br/>
This can act as a remote controll as well as starting scripts running on your PC<br/>
I have posted an example config file for this if you look at the tread<br/>
"Sharing Templates and Designs" you will see how to access it</p>

<p>is there any way you could document exactly how to set up Openremote to start automatacally<br/>
under Windows</p>

The setup should ask you if you want to install Tomcat as startup service.
