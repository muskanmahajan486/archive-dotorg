				    <p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to the whole HA deal, though I've been interested in it for a while. I've just recently started to look into it more seriously, purely as a hobby though. When I found OpenRemote, I was extremely excited! I love the idea that I would be able to custom fit my own HA system to my needs, and I would love the ability to delve into the inner-workings of it as well, considering programming is a hobby of mine. I've made/am making iPhone applications, so that's the kind of medium I'm looking at using for my own uses.<br/>
I've been doing a lot of reading and such (I don't really know all that much about the hardware side of HA yet, but I'm trying to learn!) and I thought I had it figured out, but I'm now a little confused and could use some help sorting out what I'd need to get up and running with OR. For starters, I wanted to set up a remote (my iPod Touch) to control the media devices in one room (stereo, tv, dvr, etc). It would include pretty basic macros: switching inputs on the various devices and such. I figured this would be an easy way to get used to how the system works, then I can move on to harder projects later. What kind of hardware would I need to set this up? Could I make this setup work by buying/building the OpenRemote Orb and then creating the panels and setting up the macros and all? Or would I need to buy a whole system like the X10 to make it work? Also, what kind of adaptors do the appliances need?<br/>
Like I said, I need help on the hardware side and understanding what exactly I need to purchase to start fooling around with this software. I appreciate any help from the community! =)</p>

<p>Details depend on what kind of devices you're looking to control &#8211; and more importantly, what types of control inputs the devices have.</p>

<p>You can use any hardware for hosting OpenRemote (Linux, Windows, Mac) as long as you have Java 6 running on it.</p>

<p>IP based control is easiest to get started with. X10 is legacy from time when powerline was the only "network" a building had. Nowadays most people have at least some kind of IP network available. If your device can take IP controls, you're all set, otherwise you will need IP-to-media bridges which can mean IP-to-infrared, IP-to-serial, IP-to-KNX and so on (depending what inputs your devices are able to receive).</p></font>

<p>For TV and IR stuff you need a IR bridge (like IRTrans or GlobalCache).  GC is going to set you back 170$ but will give you a nice IP access. </p>

<p>Then you can start with the composer, and seeing if all the devices you want to control are in the beehive database of devices (LIRC derivative), if they are you are in luck and you can start assembling your panel from the commands that your remotes offer.  Here is a way to do it: take pictures of your remotes and map the commands, this way you will have your home theater in one neat package.  </p>

<p>Then you will need the hardware to actually make it work IRTrans has been tested and works well and is cheaper than GC.  But IRTrans is USB and ORB based so you will need a spare PC with the ORB on it and IRTrans connected to it.  If you can afford GC and want to help with iphone coding then integrating the GC call (a couple of classes in java) would be a nice thing as then the communication would be from your panel to the GC stack directly. </p>

<p>Good luck, post your experiences. </p></font>
