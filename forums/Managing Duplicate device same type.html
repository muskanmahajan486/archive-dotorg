				    <p>What is the best way to create multiple device of same type? I did not see a template for devices. That would save a lot of time. Also I'm thinking that a global variable system would help things.</p>

<p>For example I could use those global variables in the command definition.</p>

<p>I'm willing to look at code and see what I can do but maybe it is something already in the work for a next release?</p>


<p>Is there anyway to pass the panel name in a variable from which the command is sent?</p>

<p>For example, if I have 2 STB-A and STB-B I could that variable to a script and then send the command based on the panel it is called. (STB-A and STB-B) like $panelName</p>


<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
