				    <p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>I'm new to OpenRemote and I'm really impressed  by what you have achieved&#33; (the more I try and fail with my experiments,  the more I'm getting impressed <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>)</p>

<p>I would like to create my own  visualization for a serverless KNX remote control for iPhone. I've to  say that I'm all new to KNX and Objective-C. However, I read alot about  these issues and I tried hard to get the code of OpenRemote KNX to work.  Unfortunately I had no success - still I'm not able to send a simple  command. What I do is setting up the connection to the gateway and  afterwards sending an "on" command (0x81) by using the given methods. I  modified the code (..printouts) and used an ethernet monitor to get an  understanding of what's going wrong. It seems that the second command  ("on") isn't sent at all. I guess I'm missing a step.. maybe more than  one. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I'm grateful for each comment.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Ulrich</p>
