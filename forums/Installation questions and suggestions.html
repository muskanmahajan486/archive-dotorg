				    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>i'am looking to setup a domotica project for my home, i have a few questions/suggestions i would like to share:</p>

<p>1-I have a ocelot controller from applied digital (<a href="http://www.appdig.com/adicon_new/ocelot.htm">http://www.appdig.com/adicon_new/ocelot.htm</a>) wich i wanna use, is this possible?</p>

<p>2-Is there a way to install/select different controllers? This would come in very handy because OR could act as a digital glue to all of ur equipment</p>

<p>3-Can OR control other software, like XBMC, astrix etc?<br/>
Also for the same reason i gave at 2</p>

<p>i looked at Linuxmce, wich i like alot, but the realy cool thing would be of u could choose your own software (operating system, media player, controler software, etc) and could use OpenRemote to "glue" them all together.</p>

<p>Also 2 way control would have to come in this concept for seeing State of lights, thermostats etc but also to choose media files</p>

<p>kind regards,<br/>
Raymond</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Raymond,</p>

<p>Thanks for writing. I'm not familiar with Ocelot but the long term plan for OpenRemote Boss is to become an integration platform just as you describe &#8211; to glue all different pieces of hardware, devices and software together with a good-looking, single-point-of-control application from iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Android devices, web interfaces, etc.</p>

<p>OpenRemote Boss runs on Java 6 platform. That means it can be installed on PC systems including Linux, Windows and Mac. Hardware that has more controller like form-factor (such as the <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/OpenRemote+Reference+Implementation+-+Hardware+Bill+of+Materials" title="OpenRemote Reference Implementation - Hardware Bill of Materials">ALIX boards</a>) can be used &#8211; currently we recommend Intel x86 instruction sets as we haven't yet found an ARM based Java6 platform to recommend yet.</p>

<p>Plan is to have community provide integrations to software like XBMC, Asterix, etc. We provide protocol integrations through our <a href="http://composer.openremote.org/demo">Online Tools</a> which you can use to create integration. Currently support TCP/IP, Telnet, HTTP, KNX, X10 interfaces with request/response semantics. As we are getting the integration platform ready with the next OR Boss 2.0 release, will be looking to extend protocol, device and software integrations and provide pre-defined templates for these.</p>

thanks for the quick responce, i am going try and get the xbmc control working but i don't have alot of sparetime so it might take some time.</p>

<p>Are there any examples from others who are controlLing software through OR that i can work off?</p>

<p>From what i understand the 2 way communication (and thus the ability to read database from xbmc) wil be in the 2.0 controller software? Is this correct?</p>

<p>Last, could u give me any pointers in how to get to my goals?</p>

<p>Thanks up front,</p>

<p>In the OpenRemote User Interface composer you can enter the URL details mentioned on the above page into the HTTP dialog. Then drag the resulting button onto your iPhone screen.</p>

<p>In OpenRemote 2.0 it is possible for devices to "push" status updates back to console - so for example if there was something changed on XBMC via other means than through the OpenRemote console.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Super i will look into that!</p>

<p>Can u tell when the 2.0 software comes available?<br/>
I tried to login with my account on the link in your 1 post but couldn't get in.</p>

<p>Also how do i get the medialist from xbmc showing up on openremote, so i can choose the files i wanna play?</p>

<p>Another thing is maybe not for u (Juha) but if someone could help me with the Ocelot, that would be awesome.<br/>
The Ocelot can send and recieve ir, x10 and rs232.<br/>
I have a adicon module for it that has 16 ir ins and 1 out; a x10 module; and 2 rs232 bobcats for it. So if i can get it to work i can do alot with it and that would be great.<br/>
The Ocelot needs to be connected to the pc via the serial-port.<br/>
I found the protocal on their site (<a href="http://www.appdig.com/adicon_new/design.htm">http://www.appdig.com/adicon_new/design.htm</a>)<br/>
there is alot of info in their site.</p>

<p>I know i ask alot of questions, but i figure, my questions and ideas can also help others and that in my opinion is also what opensource is all about.</p>

<p>Thanks upfront,<br/>

<p>For medialist, the short answer is you can't &#8211; the longer answer is depending on the application case it might require dynamic UI components, such as dynamic lists or tables, with actions (commands) bound to those elements. That's the generic solution and it will take some work so I don't expect it to come soon (unless there's a sudden infusion of developers). A shortcut to that is possibly a XBMC specific driver (or scripting) where push is used for UI updates but all the details would need to be sorted out.</p>

<p>The current OR assumption is a fairly static UI (lights and such) which you modify rarely, rather than something like a medialist which updates frequently so the UI update should be automated. It's an interesting use case but not currently in the development priorities.</p>

<p>Instead, if you have a look at the XBMC HTTP API, you can use OR for distinct commands, such as mute, play, stop, play next, play previous and so on. In addition you can send some UI commands to XBMC's interface, which may give you an option of choosing your media to play remotely from OR console but with visuals on your XBMC screen, for example (instead of trying to replicate the entire XBMC UI in your iPhone interface).</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I have very similar ideas like Raymond. Many software players have TCP or HTTP remote control functions. Now you could control them with OR via the TCP and HTTP interfaces, but as you said you can't do nothing more than a regular remote control with hardware buttons - prev, next, stop, play... A LIST control must be implemented to lists some kind of data - audio and video files, mails, RSS, any other stuff. But this requires the scripting language to be ready, so you could write a script that parses a XML to that list, RSS, XBMC media list or something.</p>

<p>Another thing that I think it's much more easier to implement (and that's why I hope it will be sooner) is the CCTV camera support. I see it like this - you have a capture card or DVR that streams video data in some format. The format I prefer is H.264, because it is a widely used standard - iPhone, Android, Symbian and WM plays H.264 streams and also Flash Player which is used if there will be Flash interfaces (and I'm thinking of developing such an interface).</p>

<p>Then there must be implemented a control in the Interface Builder (resizable rectangle with just URL parameter) and of course this control must be supported in the clients (iPhone and Android consoles and the web client).</p>


<p>I think it is time to start thinking of expanding the OR capabilities. This is the best open source software for Home Automation, but is still far from the "KILLER APP" prize, because it misses many general functions. I would like to help with what I can. I'm personally interested in OR.</p></font>

"Then there must be implemented a control in the Interface Builder (resizable rectangle with just URL parameter) and of course this control must be supported in the clients (iPhone and Android consoles and the web client)"</p>

<p>that was the sort of idea i had for the mediaplaylist from xbmc, idon't want to get 'all' of xbcm into the OR, its not needed <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>one thing that came to mind, i have multiple xbmc installations, a good way to tell OR wich to control would be to implement 'rooms' via multiple OR screens.<br/>
so u would be able to tell OR where u are and there would pop up the screen of the room u are in (with all the controls for that room and xbmc).<br/>
perhaps with a floorplan for the lights?</p>

<p>for the release-date of the 2.0 software and how to control my Ocelot, should i need to do a post in the developers forum?</p>

<p>great to see that ideas are interchanged and that something is done with it.</p>
