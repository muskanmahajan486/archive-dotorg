				    <p>Hi community,</p>

<p>I have a slightly abberant question, but I'm pretty confident some folks here are able to help.</p>

<p>I might have changed the UDP port of my KNX node type 20300 from the default UDP port 1634 to ???<br/>
It is now undiscoverable by any tool I know :<br/>
OR, ETS3 or 4, eibnetmux, Net'n'node, KNXlanconfig (the tool where I think I change the value for the UDP-port)<br/>
From some devices on my network I get a reply when pinging the fixed IP-address of the KNX node, not so from other.<br/>
I did arp and rarp request, but couldn't retrieve anything by MAC-address.<br/>
I do not see other connectors like serial or USB to connect with.</p>

<p>Now, as I could not immediately find any related posts by google or eib-forum, and can not find any manual about the device, but would like to get things running quickly, I hope someone here can help.<br/>
Does anyone know how I might get a connection with the KNX-node...<br/>
If not, is there a way to reset the device so it is set to the default LAN-configuration (I believe that it is DHCP with UDP 1634).<br/>
All other suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>btw : I really do appreciate the OR initiative.<br/>
It takes a bit of learning, but once it runs and is configured well I think it is really nice software.</p>
