				    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>As the subject suggests, is it possible to execute an app locally on a android handset? I understand that the controller is on the PC and see the challenge here, but thought it was worth the ask.</p>

<p>I currently have control of the amplifier via serial and am looking to control JRiver MC, which is also resident on the same PC as the controller. Ideally it could be done so from the same screen either by figuring out how to interact with the software from openremote or by executing the JRMC android app on the handset.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario the apps stay separate or enable multi-windows and have them side by side provided the tab I pick up supports this - i.e. Samsung devices, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br/>
Steve</p>
