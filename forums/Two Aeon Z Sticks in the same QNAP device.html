				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Is it possible to connect two Aeon Z Sticks to one QNAP device, and have them both recognised by OpenRemote?</p>

<p>I have my office and IT equipment in an outbuilding, over 30m from the house. There is network connectivity between the office and house, by way of 4 CAT5E cable runs. To control the Z-Wave devices in the home, I plan to use one of these cable runs with a <a href="http://www.dcdi.co.uk/product/356/adaptors/201/usb-adaptors/875/usb-over-rj45-extender/I702060?gclid=CjwKEAiAg_CnBRDc1N_wuoCiwyESJABpBuMXMSu7dhhlCimOF3xAf93p8_aYR_YImHQ3xFt5h-cK9RoCM4zw_wcB">USB over CAT5e</a> device, thus connecting the Z-Stick in the home, to the QNAP in the office.</p>

<p>I don't know if this will work and I can't see why it won't so assuming it does, I now have an issue where I would like to control some garden lights and a fish pond pump. The switches are in the office and therefore are out of range of the Z-Stick in the house. My idea is to connect a second Z-stick to the QNAP with some Z-Wave relay's in the office.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to install a DIN rail mounted 2-channel relay straight into the consumer unit located into the office, however I only have 4 spare ways on the consumer unit, ruling out C-BUS and this KNX device seems to require a 24 volt rail, rather than the 230 V rail found in an ordinary consumer unit.</p>

<p>If anyone knows if one can run two Z-Sticks in the same device or come up with a better solution, I'd be grateful if you would point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>W.</p>

<p>Z-Wave is famous for it's mesh network. Every mains powered Z-Wave node acts as a repeater in the Z-Wave network. The max range between two Z-Wave nodes is 100 meters when used outdoors with no obstructions. In theory it should be possible to create a single Z-Wave mesh network that covers your home and office. Maybe a device like the <b>Aeon Labs Range Extender</b> could help.</p></font>

<p>Good to know about the range, shame the range extenders are not made with UK 3-pin plugs. (or shame the UK's plugs and sockets are different to mainland Europe!)</p>

<p>I found an <a href="http://www.audon.co.uk/ethernetrelay/X-WR-1R12-1I5-E.html">Ethenet 240V relay</a> from "WebRelay" with PoE and a built in webserver that I was investigating purchasing and installing into the consumer unit in the office. The DIN rail is the right size, but I am not sure if it would be allowed under UK Part-P building control. A question for my Sparky.</p>

<p>A quick search on OpenRemote forums didn't return a hit for WebRelay, but I am sure it could be programmed especially as it support XML.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>W.</p></font>
