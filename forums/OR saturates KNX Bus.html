				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>My Open Remote configuration is quite heavy and consists of several pages with many many sensors and switches.<br/>
I constantly improve it and add new pages and last time it starts to saturate my KNX bus.<br/>
Which means some KNX telegrams are not reaching the destination (lost), which is quite bad!<br/>
 When i check the BUS traffic in ETS4 group monitoring I see that most of telegrams are coming from the Open Remote controller which constantly reads the status of sensors. <br/>
Is there way to control somehow the frequency of reading in the controller? Or may be there are some other solutions?</p>

<p>The controller runs on Synology NAS based on Atom CPU.</p>

I had similar issue which was due OR had one wrong group address and one address didn't had read flag set on ETS. I have noticed that it is easy to end up with wrong flags in ETS. Usually they don't generate problems between knx-devices but OR needs that flags are correctly set.</p></font>
