				    <p>I've read the WIKI page and scanned some forums here, and I don't seem to be coming up with it. I have an unRAID NAS, and there is a gorgeous docker plugin that's available that I can run OpenRemote with. I saw the WIKI page had the Alix board, which would be a great choice, if it weren't for the system specs. Is there another small footprint integrated board now recommended or in high use that you all would recommend? Or if I could just run OpenRemote on my unRAID NAS with some type of USB controller that would be fantastic! Sorry for being such a n00b in this field, but I'd love to dive in and am just looking for a bit of direction. I like the idea of housing this in it's own box, and backing it up both the data, and with a large UPS (especially if it's going to control things like door locks and security lights or possibly a security camera system). What are all of you currently using? Can I just basically take an old recycled dell optiplex or something similar with a few GB of RAM and a dual or quad core processor with a zwave interface or something in it? I'm looking to have an actual server for my automation, but save as much money in the process that I can.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help in advance!</p>

<p>My experience with OR: I started with it in a QNAP server then moved it to a Raspberry Pi 2. It doesn't take much to run the controller. And the designer (for the standard version) is through the cloud, so nothing to run there. </p>

<p>On RPI, it's been completely stable - running for months - once I got the RPI all up-to-date on good firmware that works with current MicroSD cards. And it sure wouldn't take much battery to keep an RPI working if that's your interest. </p></font>

<p>I can't give any news on results as yet, but I'm trying to create an OpenRemote server on a Din Rail mounted BeagleBone Black.</p>

<p>So far its looking good, I'll post more information when I have more time to work on it.</p></font>

<p>I've finally found a few hours to sit and play with the BeagleBone Black.</p>

<p>The good news is that it is now happily running an OpenRemote Pro server <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>


<p>I need to tidy up the start up process, but the important detail is that it's running.</p></font>
