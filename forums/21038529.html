				    <p>I've been having an issue since last night, working with the designer. I'd add some elements to a screen (a few different images and buttons), and save it. Each time I got a "saved successfully" message. I would then log out and back in and the elements were gone. I had uploaded a few images and they were still uploaded but the images were not on the screens any more. I finally was able to get things "saved" when I logged out and back in and got it so that the items appeared to be really saved. This morning I logged back in and all the work was gone again. </p>

<p>Here's the interesting part... After they saved correctly last night, I Did a sync with the online designer and got the images/buttons to show up correctly on my iPad. The images and buttons I created are on my iPad but no on the online designer.</p>

<p>Is there something up with the online Designer? (Or is there some issue on my part locally?)</p>
