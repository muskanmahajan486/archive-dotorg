				    <p>First I want to thank you all because this project is possible, I hope I can work with you in the future when I have more experience </p>

<p>I have a problem with the latest version openremote, I'm not sure but I think that problem arose when I created the new objects combined at this point why it worked perfectly ... The problem is that not Connect with gateway knx-ip or a few seconds after you exit the application and returns to iphone menú (also lets you disable the gateway knx-ip for 1 min or so, that I have positive proof, why since ETS I can't communicate until after this time, my gateway is to Baos 770) </p>

<p>I deleted the combined objects and nothing, then I have been eliminating groups and folders to stay only with the configuration of the gateway and IP address of the gateway knx and continue past the same .. Only be solved if I make a new project and no problems until I do a restore of the "infected" ... </p>

<p>I made a backup of the project, would you do me a favor if someone pro-life if it happens the same and confirm that there is problem of my gateway? I created a gmail for you can download the project .. </p>
