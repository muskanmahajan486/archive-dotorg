<p>On the iPhone under settings is ther any way to deleate old controlers?</p>


<p>In designer Would it be possable for Device to have the defolt IP and Port with the option to change if required in the command?</p>

<p>In designer would it be posable to have a copy option for Devices and Commands and when copying a device have the option to change its IP and Port</p>

<p>and have these changed in the commands attached to this device?</p>

<p>In Designer could the be an option for saving a device on its own and also have the facility to share devices?</p></font>

<p>Yes, agreed. This can be achieved with a low effort of remembering the last used parameter value (for the device) to medium-range effort of allowing/using configuration options per device in the designer to a larger effort where devices are stored as a data-structure and exchanged between designer and controller. </p>

<p>The low-effort would be something that is at least easy for someone to get started with by providing a patch.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback, Pierce.</p>

<p>Swipe sideways over the controller URL in the settings screen and a delete button should appear.</p>

<p>(yeah, not exactly obvious)</p>

<p>All are very good suggestions, thanks. I'll add to the implementation list.</p></font>
