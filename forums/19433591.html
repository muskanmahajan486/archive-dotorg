<p>I created some screens in Open Remote Boss online tools 2.0. All was well, and then I went and clicked on one of the screens I created, and the previous one stayed in the designer GUI. After clicking elsewhere and then clicking back on the screen I was missing, I noticed the 'Error on Page' given by IE/Firefox on the bottom status bar.</p>

<p>I thought this was a fluke, but then it happened on another screen. The only common denominator seems to be that I tried using the Grid widget on both of these screens</p>

<p>I have since recreated the one screen, but I lost everything from the original screen. Is there a way to get it back?</p>

<p>The error reported by IE/firefox(tried both) is:</p>

<p>That is very annoying, not sure about getting back your previous screens but chances are not I would say.</p>

<p>A couple of points though, if you have the option I would definitely use a webkit based browser such as Chrome or Safari as these seem to work with GWT (which is what the designer is written in) a lot better.</p>

<p>If you do suddenly see some weird things going on in the designer close the window and log back in as this will limit any corruption as the designer frequently auto saves.</p>

<p>The bugs/limitations of the current designer are clear to everyone and it needs a big update (as it was written with a long outdated version of GWT), this will likely be something I pick up once I get the Web Console 2.0 released.</p>
