				    <p>Hi I'm new to this so go easy on me if this has already been done.</p>

<p>I have just started playing with openremote to control my russound CAV6.6 devices from my phones etc, however I notice no events exist for play button/next/previous/return now playing etc is this intentional?</p>

<p>Also could the controller on the PC not act in two ways, one to send command from an openremote panel to the russound, and two pickup the commands from a CAV6.6 panel and issue these out to the PC.</p>

<p>For example I want to: When on the openremote/CAV6.6 panel the Play button is pressed, the openremote controller picks this up, and calls say a configurable set of HTTP commands to control whatever media software/device you wish to control (as most these days have a HTTP interface)</p>

<p>Any help would be great.</p>
