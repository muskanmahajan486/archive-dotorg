				    <p>Trying to get OR working with IRtrans ethernet v2.3 irdb.<br/>
1. I setup a remote in IRtrans db on my laptop called 'test' (make sure the irtranstray.exe is running prior to starting the 'GUIClient')<br/>
2. In IR GUI client: learned a command from my yamaha remote called 'yamahaonoff'.<br/>
3. edited the remote.irm file on my laptop to have:<br/>
POS120,10	SIZE100,30TEXTYamaha On/Off REMOTEtest	COMMANDyamahaonoff<br/>
4.tried testing with the irtremote gui(both at my laptop IP and the irtrans ip (command line option)). when testing, irtrans kept giving me a message that the IR port did not exist.<br/>
Discovered this line in remote.irm needed to be changed from:<br/>
SLED15  to<br/>
SLED1<br/>
as my irtrans ethernet version does not have 15 IR transceivers, so I set it to the first one, i.e. SLED1<br/>
5. Flashed the ir trans device<br/>
6. tried the irremote gui from my laptop, it works to turn my yamaha on/off, yay!<br/>
7. tried the irremote GUI pointed (command line parameter) to my itrans ip, it works to turn my yamaha on/off. yay!<br/>
8. assigned the command:<br/>
Asnd test, yamahaonoff<br/>
 to a button called 'power' in OR online designer.<br/>
Assigned IP of my itrans device, port 21000, TCP/IP . (pretty much followed the video posted on OR)<br/>
9. OR gave error 'invalid URL' from my android when I pressed the button I assigned the command to<br/>
10. scratched my head. relooked at the IP specified in the command in OR designer.<br/>
11. decided to change my open remote connection on my android from 
<a href="http://beehive.openremote.org/3.0/alpha5/rest/user/jasonn1234">http://beehive.openremote.org/3.0/alpha5/rest/user/jasonn1234</a><br/>
to <a href="http://192.168.1.68:8080/controller">http://192.168.1.68:8080/controller</a><br/>
12. went to <a href="http://localhost:8080/controller/">http://localhost:8080/controller/</a> on my laptop(OR controller resides on my laptop) and synced with online designer<br/>
13. on my android: shut off my 3G. turned on my wifi and connected to my house wireless<br/>
14. restarted OR on my android <br/>
15. received this error message in the controller log file everytime I pressed the button:<br/>
Controller2011-11-17 19:16:48,031 INFO HTTP\-Thread\-8 org.openremote.controller.protocol.socket.TCPSocketCommand.requestSocket(153) | received message: **00040 RESULT Remote Command not found<br/>
16. Rereviewed the video for the 24th time!<br/>
17. changed the command for 'power' in OR online designer to: Asnd test,yamahaonoff   NOTICE no space after the comma<br/>
18. resynced with online designer<br/>
19. pressed the 'power' button on my OR panel on my android. observed the power on my yamaha go off!<br/>
20. smiled, it works!<br/>
21. shut off the irtrans server from my tray<br/>
22. repeated 19. above. It still works! This demonstrates the IRtranstray only needs to be run to learn the IR codes and flash the device. As the IR trans GUI cient wont run without the irtranstray running</p>

<p>Thanks OR!</p>

<p>Basically the video is dead on with a few nuances above. If at some point the error message in 9. could be changed to reflect the correct error message, it may help someone in the future. The url may be unreachable, but it is certainly not invalid...or at least the IP specified was not</p>
