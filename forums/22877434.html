				    <p>Sorry folks, if this is bringing up old hashed material, but I'm new to OR and specifically was looking this route due to a need/desire to use with my existing X10 equipment.  I previously used the CM15A module with X10's ActiveHome Pro software, along with all sorts of other X10 equipment (in-wall, plug-in, motion sensors, and cameras).  A recent system crash caused me to have to reload the X10 software and it turns out they have a newer version, which prevents my existing version from being installed.  So I figured this gives me a good reason to consider an alternative software, and I came across OpenRemote.  The possibilities for expansion to all my other goodies was AWESOME!  But my basic need is to manage my X10 devices.  I installed the program and was looking in the Designer and documentation on the website, but can't find any information on how to setup the X10 devices.  The only indication I can see regarding the CM15 interface, is in regards to use with Linux via Mochad, using TCP.  I've been searching the forums all day, and am shocked at what I think I'm finding as a conclusion to my search.  Is this Linux really the ONLY way to use a USB interface for x10?  Am I missing something here?  If so, how can that be, since there are other windows based software that easily communicate via USB with the CM15A module (including X10's own poorly designed ActiveHome Pro)?  Especially since it's been a few years since I've even seen a serial port connection on a basic off-the-self PC (not to mention a laptop).  What is it that is the limiting capability?  Or have I just somehow dumbfoundedly completely missed a whole section of documentation on the subject, that is tucked away somewhere on the website?  Can someone please help with my understanding of the situation?</p>

<p>That's correct.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, so far there hasn't been much interest in developing CM15 support for Windows. I agree it would be nice to have but other integrations have taken the priority. CM15 for Linux via mochad exists because there's a mochad community that wants to develop and maintain it.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to step up, and assuming that the CM15 USB on Windows is exposed as a serial port, then Lawrie's serial interface is probably the easiest point to get started. </p>

<p>The other option then is to get familiar with Linux instead. That's the situation today. Hope it can be improved <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>
