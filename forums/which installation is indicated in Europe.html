				    <p>Hello, I own an existing house with dual contact bticino switches and need to replace my heating boiler. Two heating zones, one with existing radiators, and in the other we will place a floorheating system with a new thermostat.<br/>
I can program (although a little rusty) and would like to know which controller, which main communication protocol between parts. I live in Belgium and do not want to buy exotic material (meaning hard to find once it has to be replaced)<br/>
With the solution, i want to<br/>
operate the home cinema<br/>
operate the lights in the house<br/>
operate the heatingsystem for the two zones, also remotely (can the nest thermostat talk to the openremote system?)<br/>
operate the bticino parlofony<br/>
operate the frontdoor lock</p>

<p>can someone point me to some principles and trademarks, where to look for?</p>

<p>thx</p>

<p>Olivier</p>
