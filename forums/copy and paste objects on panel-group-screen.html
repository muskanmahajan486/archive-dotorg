                                    <a name="comment-23597252"></a>
                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for the update. That is too bad because it would be very nice to have that feature. (I even looked at copying sections of the XML code to do this (re-naming pieces) but that looked like it would be too much trouble in the long run.)</p>

<p>The following is just a couple of suggestions/questions in light of the current times. No offence is meant to anyone. Below is just my opinion.</p>

<p>Does the professional designer still sell many copies? Are people buying it? Just a suggestion but if it was cheaper, maybe more of us "non-professionals" might consider it.... right now it's a bit out of my price range. I would love to use it but can't really afford it.</p>

<p>I also wonder if there has been much development on the hardware box/appliance? The prices on this type of hardware (embedded Linux) has dropped radically and power of them increased in recent years. So the box should probably drop in price as well. With the Vera lite and the Smartthings hubs being at aprox $100 (US), it makes it hard to consider the Openremote box.</p>

<p>I am a very big fan of Openremote. Having tried many other of the open source tools (OpenHab and ComfortClick to name two) and I keep coming back to Openremote. It feels like home automation solutions are just about to emerge into a much bigger entity, it would be nice to see Openremote keep up with the times. In the US, Home Depot, Lowes and Comcast are all jumping into it (home automation) and it looks like Apple and Google are soon to follow. It feels like Openremote could be part of this, if things were done correctly.</p>

<p>So, thank you to everyone that has helped developed Openremote over the years and please don't give up on the project. It is a good one.</p>

<p>Openremote is a powerful interface but it's a pity fast limited by the options designer</p></font>
