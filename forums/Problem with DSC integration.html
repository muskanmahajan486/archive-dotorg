				    <p>I've got the DSC alarm panel linked to OR using an Envisalink module.  I had it on a Raspberry Pi which seem to lose the connection after a few hours.  I thought that the problem was related to the Pi and the fact that I had quite a large number of panels and rules.   To eliminate that I set up a second Pi just to run the DSC functions and rules for automated lighting.  This was working fine for a few days then it crashed.  I rebooted and it lasted almost a day then gradually this has come down to a few hours.  I am guessing that there is something which builds up on the Pi and causes the connection to drop out.  OR keeps running fine but the Envisalink stops sending Open and Restored alarm data.  In the Envisalink portal I get a message at the time the interface dropped which says TPI session closed.</p>

<p>I can't find anything in the DSC logs it just seems to stop.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do??</p>

<p>I've included the debug log in the logs/dsc/dsc-debug.log enabled by default in the configuration. That should give more detailed logs compared to dsc.log that only records level INFO and above.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>OK I've had this running a few days and I am reaching the conclusion that the system overloads itself.  I have a set of rules that turns on lights according to the status of DSC detectors.  I've got one detector on the front door which turns on a light in the evenings.  If the door is left open then it is continually polling the Legrand system to turn on the light which definitely causes the interface to fall over.  I've switched that off for now.  A workaround for this would be useful - I guess the same issue might crop up if we had a party with all zones continually showing movement.  I assume if we could get the Legrand interface working at least we could check that the light was already on and not keep sending the "light on" command.</p>

<p>In the new dsc log file I get just the following (masses of trace - not whether that is a problem?:</p>

I would expect closing of the <b>connection</b> to show up in the logs somehow, if nothing else at least as an attempt to rebuild the connection (which the OR implementation should do, and it should turn up in the debug log).</p>

<p>If Envisalink is just closing the session but not the connection then that might not prompt anything on OR side, or maybe not initially unless and if connection times out eventually.</p>

<p>I would however expect EnvisaLink then to create a new session on creating a new connection.</p>

<p>Is there a timeout configuration for EnvisaLink sessions? Do we need to keep a heartbeat going on the connection to prevent the closing of session?</p></font>

<p>In the meantime I found some documentation at <a href="http://forum.eyez-on.com/FORUM/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=301">http://forum.eyez-on.com/FORUM/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=301</a><br/>
that had a section that might help :</p>

<p>The Envisalink acts as a server for the TCP connection and the user application is the client. The Envisalink listens on<br/>
port 4025 and will only accept one client connection on that port. Any subsequent connections will be denied.<br/>
The Envisalink will close the connection if the client closes its side.<br/>
To initiate a connection, the application must first start a session by establishing a TCP socket. Once established the TPI<br/>
will send a 5053 command (See section 3.0 for a detailed description of the protocol) requesting a session password.<br/>
The client should then, within 10 seconds, send 005 login request. The 005 command contains the password which is the<br/>
same password to log into the Envisalink's local web page. Upon successful login, the Envisalink's TPI will respond with<br/>
the session status command, 505, and whether the password was accepted or rejected. If a password is not received<br/>
within 10 seconds, the TPI will issue a 5052 command and close the TCP socket. The socket will also be closed if the<br/>
password fails.<br/>
Once the password is accepted, the session is created and will continue until the TCP connection is dropped.</p>

<p>Note, as with all network communications, it is possible the TCP socket could be lost due to a network disruption, or an<br/>
exception at either the client or server end. Application programmers are advised to include some handling for dropped<br/>
connections. The Poll command (000) is a useful command to test of the connection is still alive. Alternately, an<br/>
application could watch for the period time broadcast (510) which is issued by the panel every 4 minutes.</p></font>

The dsc log file just suddenly stops at the time that the session closes with the DSC interface.  <br/>
There are a few debug warnings in the dev log at start up which may be something.  Otherwise the dev log just keeps showing all the zones restored even though some should be showing open.</p>
