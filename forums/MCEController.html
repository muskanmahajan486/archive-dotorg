				    <p>Hi</p>

<p>I'm new to OpenRemote and trying to get a a couple of things to work.  One is control of Media Center using MCEController.  I'm able to send a single command successfully but it will not recognize subsequent commands.  I'm using the TCP/IP option with just the command in the "Command box (eg down).  </p>

<p>I'm also trying to control my Yamaha RX-Z7 receiver, anyone had any luck with that one?</p>

				    
                                            <div class="tabletitle">

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Stefan</p>

<p>some time ago I experimented with MCE and was only able to send one command before it locked up. I was not sure if open remote</p>

<p>was sending a carriage return at the end and this was locking up the process. I was able to send all the commands using Putty with no</p>

<p>problems. There were some posts on the forum and I did have some communications with Juha regarding getting this to work correctly.</p>

<p>I also experimented with MCE Virtual remote which was based on MCE but I did not have any luck.</p>

<p>I would be interested with getting this to work with OR as if offers several interesting possibilities not only as a media remote but to launch&nbsp; applications on a PC using OR.</p>

<p>Regarding controlling the RX-Z7 I have also had some discussions with Juha about writing a protocol to control this sort of amp. Hew has kindly offered to write me an example of this protocol to get me started. As soon as I have any news on this I will let you know. I have also posted several</p>

<p>items on my progress controlling thees amps.</p>

<p>If you make any progress please let me know</p>

<p>Pierce</p></font>

<p>So have you been able to get the Yamaha to respond to any commands at all?  </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi there.</p>

<p>Sorry so late to this, but i wonder if you found a solution to the MCE Controller problem.</p>

<p>I did find out some more information than I found in your posing - and that is after the 1st command is received by the MCEController you can see in the Status Icons that MCEController has gone from "Listening on Port 5150" to "Client Connected and Awaiting Commands", but it never reverts back to "Listening" after the 1st command completes.</p>

<p>This implies that OpenRemote is opening the socket, sending the 1st command, but never closing the socket again, and this is why all subsequent commands fail (because the socket is alreay open).</p>

<p>I have proved this to be the case - but surely after you guys were discussing this in January you have a solution or a workround?</p>

<p>Please let me know... many thanks</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Martyn</p>

<p>Regarding the MCE controler I have had some sucess setting using this.</p>

<p>I have uploaded a template in designer which has all of the commands<br/>
you will have to change it to your IP and port</p>

<p>If you open designer<br/>
Go into Panel<br/>
Go New <br/>
New Screan From Template<br/>
Pick Public<br/>
Search for MCE</p>

<p>This should bring up MCE Controler if you load this it should bring up my design and <br/>
also load MCE as a device which will give you all the commands.</p>

<p>For your info I have sucesfully configured Open Remote to controll a Yamaha RX 2065<br/>
I believe it should work for other models and I will be uploading an example soon</p>

<p>The difference between what you are doing and what I was doing is you are using telnet (I did try that, but wasn't putting a "null|" before the command (why is that necessary?)...</p>

<p>I was using TCP/IP, but for one-way communication I don't suppose that matters.</p>

<p>Although my utopia is that I want to control MediaPortal, so ultimately 2-way comms would be better.... <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>
