				    <p>Hey fellow OpenRemoters,</p>

<p>I've been anxious to try OpenRemote on my Android G2. So I set up a controller, created a panel, downloaded Android app and was hoping I'm off to the races. In the OpenRemote Settings screen, I configured my controller's URL and was able to select the panel I've created in the web editor. Unfortunately, this is where I'm stuck. The two buttons at the bottom of the Settings screen - Done and Cancel are inaccessible, so I cannot close the Settings window. I know it sounds silly, but here I am, the buttons do not respond to the touch. Any ideas?</p>

				    
                                            <div class="tabletitle">
                            <a name="comments">Comments:</a>
                        </div>

                        <table border="0" width="100%">

<p>I'll try to reproduce this as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, can you provide a screenshot + other details of your configuration?</p></font>

The very bottom of the screen does not seem to respond to touch. Unfortunately, the app does not support landscape mode. Actually, if I launch it from landscape mode, it starts up in landscape mode properly, but as soon as screen switches to portrait, the apps locks in portrait mode and never switches back to landscape.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Interesting.  If I remember correctly, I made a change (that's probably not available in the market yet) to allow the AppSettingsActivity (which is what you're using) to change orientation.  I believe it was portrait-only before.</p>

<p>Dealing with orientation changes for that particular activity is a bit tricky, because it launches a background thread to auto-discover controllers, and an orientation change causes the currently running activity to be destroyed and then recreated.  If the background thread still refers to the activity in its original incarnation and then the orientation changes, problems could ensue ...</p></font>
