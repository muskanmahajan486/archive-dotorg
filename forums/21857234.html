				    <p>Hey!</p>

<p>I finally just got my openremote box running and controlling my Russound CAS44 unit. Loving it so far!</p>

<p>I presently have a setup where I have an airport express feeding source 1 of my russound box music over AirPlay. It's worked great so far, as I mostly play music from my iPhone to the unit. Well, now after using the application, it seems that whenever I open the openremote app and music is playing the audio is paused. Whenever I switch back to the music app I have to start the music again. This happens anytime I open the Openremote app, it's as if iOS thinks that that app has its hooks in iOSs audio system and it's in control.</p>

<p>Is there any way around this behaviour or to disable it? I also notice that the iOS menubar icon at the top always shows up in red for about a second after leaving the app, kinda like it looks when your recording audio in the voice memo app and is running in the background.</p>

<p>Finally, one last question. The last time this app was updated was in 2011. Are there any plans for newer versions - notably one with iPhone 5 resolution support?</p>

<p>Thanks for all the hard work!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>There's a new iOS app in the pipeline for distribution (once I can figure out what's going wrong with signing the app for approval process) although this won't have iPhone5 resolution support per se (although will have fixes for things that were broken in iOS6), as far as I understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>What's New in this Version</b></p>

<p>The slider implementation has been changed in this version to make it work as desired on iOS 6. It is being standardised to look and behave identically on all OpenRemote console, as defined at <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/Slider" title="Slider">Slider</a>. </p>

<p>This means that sliders using custom images, that looked OK before might render incorrectly. Please update your design taking the specifications of the OpenRemote slider widget into account for correct rendering. </p>

<p>Bug fixes: </p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>If the same sensor id is used multiple times on the same page, it appears multiple times in the poll query</li>
	<li>Even when single screen in group, pagination gesture is possible and crashes the app</li>
	<li>In group with multiple page, scroll to page prior to first crashes app</li>
	<li>Sensor value not received correctly</li>
	<li>iOS console crashes on launch if can't connect to controller</li>
	<li>User authentication not taken into account</li>
	<li>Controller not found message when using remote proxy</li>
	<li>Min/max track image display on sliders do not work under iOS6</li>
	<li>Timeout downloading the images on bigger configurations</li>
	<li>Error downloading panel configuration</li>
	<li>Old message about auto-discovery is still present in UI</li>
	<li>Back button does not return to previous screen</li>
</ul>

Those take over the audio system in some way.</p>

<p>As Juha said, the coming release 2.1.1 will have this fixed + everything in the release notes.</p>

<p>The next planned version 2.2 will have additional fixes but not iPhone 5 screen resolution support yet. This require some more re-work of old code (and will also mean we drop support for anything earlier than iOS 4.3).</p>

<p>But I know this is important and we'll work on it as soon as resources / planning allows.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Eric,</p>

<p>I see you mentioned the slider changes being listed in the "What's new" section of the App Store, but since upgrading I cannot use any sliders. My setup has both horizontal and vertical sliders to control volume and other aspects such as bass and treble. But in this version, even if I press and hold the slider (and see the value bubble/magnifying glass thing) as soon as I make any horizontal movement to change the slider the zone "glides" to another zone. In other words, I have 4 buttons at the bottom of the screen for each zone, and previously I could just swipe left or right to move between them but now it registers that movement (even though I'm specifically on a slider) as a zone change.</p>

<p>Any tips? Am I missing something?</p></font>

Sorry, I'll debug that.</p>

<p>The only "work around" I would have in the short term is to use vertical sliders, because as long as you're not doing any horizontal movement, the page swipe should not register and the slider should be working.</p></font>
