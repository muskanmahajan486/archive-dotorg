				    <p>Here's some interesting news for those that want some architectural lighting sequences triggered with OpenRemote.</p>


<p>Using the TCP/IP commands in OpenRemote, I've managed to control FreeStyler X2.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freestylerdmx.be">http://www.freestylerdmx.be</a></p>

<p>Using a USB DMX dongle from SOH, which uses the Entec Open DMX profile.</p>


<p>" <a href="http://eshop.soh.cz/en/usb">http://eshop.soh.cz/en/usb</a>→dmx/i110-module-usb-dmx-512 "</p>


<p>It's a simple enough process of installing a copy of FreeStyler on a Windows machine (I haven't tried a virtual machine or Vine) then just push the TCP commands into it.</p>


<p>The only comment I'd make is that the TCP command documentation says that the value to send is 255, but only sending 25 works.<br/>
Whereas 255 doesn't.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<p>FSOC002255 doesn't work.<br/>
But<br/>
FSOC00225 does work.</p>


<p>"FSOC" signals an ASCII command<br/>
Command number 002 is to toggle the blackout<br/>
"255" is supposed to be the command value, but it didn't work, whereas "25" does.</p>

<p>The full PDF list of commands can be found in a sub folder of FreeStyler.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The good news is that it works perfectly </p>


<p>Or at least as much as I'd expect a remote control of a software DMX controller to work.</p>

<p>I haven't tried it yet, but there is a full set of 'commands line' codes  (which is a slightly different definition in lighting desk language) which should permit direct control of DMX channels, and depending on software, might even give group control.</p>

<p>So in my first test, I could control a chase sequence with TCP commands.</p>

<p>The second part was to transfer that control to a Velbus panel, which works perfectly.</p>

<p>The next step is to create more sequences in FreeStyler and control them via Velbus.</p>

<p>After that (time permitting), I'll try to create some Macros in OpenRemote to send 'Command Line' codes to FreeStyler to directly control DMX channels.</p>


<p>I've also just this second had a call from a friend who is prepared to let me test an ART-Net adapter with it, so I might well be able to control thousands of DMX channels.</p>



<p>So the short answer?</p>


<p>Yes, I got it working, very very well <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

DMX is asked for every now and than and maybe we can suggest your solution? Do you see another "more professional" solution?<br/>
What did you mean with 255 does not work but 25 does? Anything we might need to fix or we can help with?<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Marcus,</p>


<p>With the risk of opening a can of worms, the short answer is yes, I do now use basic commands in OpenRemote to trigger sequences, cues and submasters in FreeStyler to control a really simple 12 channel DMX lighting unit that I built, primarily to test OpenRemote and DMX capabilities.</p>


<p>A simple video is here</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cuedup.biz/DL/DMX_Wall-light.mp4">http://www.cuedup.biz/DL/DMX_Wall-light.mp4</a></p>

<p>However, if I were to deploy a DMX solution into a professional situation, I would adopt a similar approach but use wildly different DMX control hardware.</p>


<p>FreeStyler is an okay 2 universe DMX controller, with a functional yet clunky interface.<br/>
For live (Disco/Band) use, I'm sure it's fine.</p>


<p>For large scale architectural DMX installations that use more than 1024 channels, something more robust is required.</p>

<p>A number of LanBox-LCX would be very good devices, which can be remotely controlled by TCP instructions to trigger sequences and cues.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lanbox.com/page.php?12">http://www.lanbox.com/page.php?12</a></p>


<p>Or there are professional Soft-Desk DMX solutions like MagicQ.<br/>
(Also available as standalone lighting desks)</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/magicq">https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/magicq</a></p>

<p>The issue with the MagicQ soft desk (which is available for Windows and Linux) is that it requires a Professional grade USB to DMX adapter to unlock the TCP remote command feature.<br/>
The basic adapter only unlocks a few features.</p>


<p><a href="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/ch32.html">https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/ch32.html</a></p>


<p>So in short, </p>

<p>FreeStyler works reasonably well for domestic / semi-pro DMX applications.</p>


<p>For anything more demanding then the &gt;€700 investment in hardware is worth every cent.</p>


<p>As always, it comes down to imagination Vs. budget.</p>


<p>But to be painfully clear on what I was attempting.<br/>
I wanted to prove that OpenRemote could control a DMX lighting controller, rather than OpenRemote directly controlling any DMX fixtures.</p>


<p>I'll talk about the DMX controlled water fountain, when I've spent some more time on it <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>


<p>With specific regard to the 255 and 25 issue, its a tiny detail to do with the FreeStyler commands, rather than OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Cheers<br/>
Stuart</p></font>
