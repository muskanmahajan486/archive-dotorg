				    <p>OpenRemote developers and users. Be inspired by this video! When I move to a house I hope it will be like this, but with OpenRemote rather than their proprietary stuff <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Comments? Is most of it doable?</p>

It is one of the best solutions I have seen so far targetting directly to the average consumer. The video is still far out, but quite a bit is possible already (z-wave). They are developing fast and have big ambitions. However...proprietary. So if you want to do your own combinations of stuff, make your own UI, etc, it doesn't work.</p></font>

I have my whole home wired with KNX and creating a few scenes "coming home in 10min", "coming home in 5min" and "entering home" can already be created with rules. Just the link between OpenRemote and your car's GPS is missing but I am pretty sure we can use Siri for this <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>The problem with those videos is, that you never know what really works already, and what is "photoshopped" <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

<p>Regarding the presence of a particular person. Sure, GPS is cool and everything but maybe a bit complicated. What about simply having the Controller server pinging for example "JohnsIphone" every 1-10 seconds (crontab before we can have it builtin <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>) and whenever it starts answering to ping (that is, when the person enters the house/coming up the driveway and automatically connects to the Wifi) it initiates some scenes like turning on the lights?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>As Marcus said, most of it is doable, I would say that the only thing I've seen that's not here right now is the voice control.<br/>
Siri won't work as there is no API from Apple to integrate with it. But there are several libraries for iOS developer to provide speech recognition on the device (one of them being Open Source).<br/>
I looked briefly at including that in our iOS console but this really was not a priority, so skipped to more useful things.<br/>
But if some iOS developers want to have a go at it, I'll be glad to provide support.</p>

<p>For the "proximity trick", I did once implement as a demo / proof of concept something similar, though with limited range. I used a small tool on the Mac that did listen for bluetooth devices and could trigger AppleScript when it detected a device connecting or disconnecting. From these scripts, I was issuing a REST call to the OpenRemote controller. So when my Mac detected my iPhone near it, it would trigger a macro in OR (and would trigger another one when iPhone went away from Mac).</p>

<p>If you find some kind of "RFID" device that can detect your car arriving near your house, you could already either have a protocol for it in OR, this could toggle a sensor value and then based on rules you can do whatever you want.</p>

<p>For video surveillance, if your cameras provide a MJPEG stream, you can use the Web element in OR and have your video displayed in the consoles already.</p>

<p>At this stage, it still requires a lot of imagination and tricks to do what you want, but we're working on making things easier.</p></font>

SIRI is contacting an APPLE server for each request and you can intercept this request if you map the server address within your LAN to a machine in your network. <br/>
That machine needs to run the <a href="https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy">SIRI prox</a> which can be used to sent REST calls to OpenRemote.</p>

<p>So, something like "Computer, please turn living room light on" is possible. </p></font>

Sure it's cool and all that but I have a hard time getting it to understand what I'm saying (and I think my english is pretty fluent) and I just end up getting mad and do it the old way - press buttons. Why not Siri?<br/>
1. Imagine if you tell it to <em>turn on living room lights</em> and it thinks I asked for opening the garage door. No way! I rather just press buttons. <br/>
2. Today we have Siri, but what about other non-Apple devices?<br/>
3. What if Apple decides to change something/remove the feature just as they did with iWork. All this time spent for nothing so I think time is better spent on other things than voice control.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents.</p></font>
