<p>The industry is extremely fragmented with 20-30 year old legacy technologies mixed with new emerging technologies, and on top very proprietary where many integrators foolishly lock data formats and protocols from open distribution. It's not easy to give a comprehensive introduction because of this, but at least it is a starting point of some kind.</p>
