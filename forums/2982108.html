				    <p>Okay, can anyone well me what the heck <a href="http://mshohm.orcsweb.com/">MS Hohm</a> is?</p>

<p>So far I found a bit on Wiki which says it's an online web application by Microsoft that enables consumers to analyze their energy usage and based on the Windows Azure cloud operating system. Supposedly it's MS's way of competing with Google's <a href="http://www.google.org/powermeter/">Powermeter</a>. But from what I can gather it doesn't have support for Smart meters (???). This sounds like you'll enter the power usage and Microsoft will provide you with pretty pictures and tell you should switch to Fluorescent bulbs. Sorry I'm a bit cranky because I couldn't find any details. I have signed up for info and I'm following them on Facebook and Twitter. Facebook has a lot of nice videos of people say how wonderful Hohm is though it sounds like they've never used it (grrr! $@#!^ marketing).</p>

So far I've not seen anything useful from their ads. More over I'm not impressed by what they do have, a blurry video of graphics on a web page. Well they'll get their chance but I'm really expecting very little from this product. It really is sad, this is not innovation.</p></font>

You login in, enter you zip code, then your information about your home (size, fuel, windows, doors, insulation age of appliances and home). After you've entered everything they tell you that there is no local provider that shares it's information (well duh!) and that you can now enter you usage data. So basically you just entered a ton of data that they can market. I'll now wait to see what shows up in my mail (email and snail mail).</p></font>
