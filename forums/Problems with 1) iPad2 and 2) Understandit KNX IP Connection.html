				    <p>At first, congratulations a bout this successful application.<br/>
This will steal me some nights <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>If its possible for me i'll try to support you.</p>

<p>I tested the openRemoteBoss 2.0 with my iPad2 and my KNX environment at home.</p>

<p>1) After I had deploying/syncing the app to my iPad I was able to start it for the first time.<br/>
I needed to enter my contoller IP (AutoDiscover hasn't work). My contoller is installed on my iMac (10.6).<br/>
After the application was synced to the device I was able to see my before designed button. Yeah great!<br/>
But I  cannot change some settings. I thought i should be able to reenter some settings like controller ip or something else?</p>

<p>2) I also wonder where I can enter my KNX IP Gateway address. In the tutorial there is only defined a name, nothing more.<br/>
Should have AutoDiscover find the propper IP ?? I have an eibmarkt N00401 Gateway. Have I understand something wrong? Where can i find some Information about that. Or who can give me a short hint.</p>

<p>Regards<br/>
Norman</p>
