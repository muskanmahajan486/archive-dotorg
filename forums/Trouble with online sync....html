				    <p>Hello,<br/>
I'm using OpenRemote for about 8 month. Controller is installed on Synology NAS.<br/>
First 6 month everything was perfect, I always used online sync to update controller data from the designer. <br/>
But 2 month ago after next editing of the design - synchronization just stop working anymore. Tried many times but all sensors/status didn't work on my iPad.<br/>
Analyzing log I found that almost all sensors and commands Id's are overlapped. So log is full of exceptions about failed sensors creation because of parsing errors (due to duplicated Id's).<br/>
So since 2 month i have to manually update controller.xml inside the zip and synchronize offline afterwards. To avoid duplicates i have to add to the commands prefix "20", so commands start from value 2000... and don't overlap with sensor Id's anymore.<br/>
But this way is very annoying since i have to do this after each design change! And unfortunately today i found that some image Id's are also overlapp with button Id's that's why some buttons didn't work as well.<br/>
Very strange that no one reports this issue here in the forum. I didn't hack anything, just used online tools and now all Id's on the online server are messed up.<br/>
Is there anyway to fix this somehow, so i can use the online sync again.<br/>
Starting the design from scratch is not an option since i spend many hours on it, and copy-paste doesn't work in the editor unfortunately.</p>
