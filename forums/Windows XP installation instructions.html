				    <p>I've been trying to install the controller on my XP laptop and have been following:
<a href="http://openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Controller+Installation">http://openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Controller+Installation</a></p>

<p>instructions</p>

<p>which say to type &gt; java -version<br/>
I did and get </p>

<p>C:\Documents and Settings\jasonn&gt;java -version<br/>
java version "1.6.0_23"<br/>
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_23-b05)<br/>
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode, sharing)</p>

<p>The instructions then say "If you see any version of Java 6 installed, you don't need to install Java. Otherwise, continue with Java installation"</p>

<p>So I assume "1.6.0_23" above from my computer actually means Java 6? </p>

<p>Not sure my assumption was correct or not, I went to the download Java Installation link on the instructions to be safe</p>

<p>This then links to a page with <br/>
Java SE and multiple links, including Java SE, development kit, Java SE, JAvaME, JAvaFX. Which one am I supposed to download?<br/>
I clicked on Java SE and another page appeared with more options:<br/>
Java Platform (JDK) 7, JavaFX 2.0 Beta, JDK 7 + NetBeans Bundle, JDK 7 + NetBeans Bundle, JDK 7 + Java EE Bundle, JDK 7 + Java EE Bundle etc</p>

<p>Which one am I supposed to download?</p>

<p>After perusing the internet for a while I've come to the conclusion that my "1.6.0_23" is actually java 6. Is this correct?</p>

<p>I also saw another post that the development environment must be installed, so I downloaded and installed jdk-6u23-windows-i586.exe</p>

<p>I then went to the next step in the instructions:<br/>
Enter "JAVA_HOME" as variable name and path to root of the Java Runtime directory (installed in step 1) as the value. </p>

<p>After perusing the internet for what Java Runtime directory actually meant(is this where java.exe resides?) and searching the blogs here, I assume this <br/>
means C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\ or is it C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23 or is it C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin or C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin\ ?</p>

<p>I put in JAVA_HOME environment variable as C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\ based on screenshot from other users. I then click okay and run</p>

<p>E:\Download\openremote\OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.0_SNAPSHOT_20110611\bin&gt;openremote run<br/>
Neither the JAVA_HOME nor the JRE_HOME environment variable is defined<br/>
At least one of these environment variable is needed to run this program</p>

<p>I double check my spelling multiple times. It is correct. I then read in another post that this variable should be in the user variables. So I put it in there and delete the system variable.</p>

<p>same answer:<br/>
E:\Download\openremote\OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.0_SNAPSHOT_20110611\bin&gt;openremote run<br/>
Neither the JAVA_HOME nor the JRE_HOME environment variable is defined<br/>
At least one of these environment variable is needed to run this program</p>

<p>I also tried setting JAVA_HOME to C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\ which I have as a directory, but no luck</p>

<p>Does anyone have step by step instructions for windows XP? or know what my issue is?</p>

I indeed installed the JDK, even if I had the JRE already there, but this made me more confident of succeding.<br/>
Then I really managed to set the environment variable correctly and entered and exited the command line at least ten times before success...<br/>
At the end, all of my problems were MY errors... <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
This post was somewhat helpful for me:
<a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12845725&amp;focusedCommentId=19432645#comment-19432645">http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12845725&amp;focusedCommentId=19432645#comment-19432645</a><br/>
This anyway does not garantee there are no problems elsewhere.<br/>
Installation on Windows XP is possible. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

Well said, and yes it took many tries to finally get the environment variable correct, but finally got it <br/>
working.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I should have followed up when I got it working</p>

<p>My JAVA_HOME is setup as a system variable with path C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\<br/>
My JAVA_HOME is also setup as a user variable with path C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\</p>

<p>Reopening the command window solved the 'At least one of these environment variable is needed to run this program' problem</p>

<p>running this<br/>
C:\Documents and Settings\jasonn&gt;echo %JAVA_HOME%<br/>
yields:<br/>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\</p>

<p>so it looks like the user variable is the one to use with the above path </p></font>
