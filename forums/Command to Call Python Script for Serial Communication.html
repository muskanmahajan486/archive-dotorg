				    <p>I'm working on the design of my home entertainment system, and I plan to install OpenRemote Controller on a MythTV backend server (Ubuntu OS), which will be located in my basement.  In the family room upstairs, I'll have a MythTV frontend (also Ubuntu OS) connected to a TV and AV receiver.  I'd like to control all three components in my family room using an Android phone (and hopefully later an Android tablet).  In my research I've discovered that both my TV and AV receiver can be controlled via RS232 ports.  I also found a nice little Python script someone else wrote to submit commands via RS232 (<a href="http://www.thelazysysadmin.net/tag/remote-control/">http://www.thelazysysadmin.net/tag/remote-control/</a>).  I figure I can modify this script and place it on my MythTV frontend.</p>

<p>To bring it all together, I'd like to create a panel button that sends a command to the Controller, which passes that command to the MythTV frontend.  From what I can tell, I need to create a command that uses the TCP/IP protocol and configure the appropriate IP (e.g. 192.168.1.x) and port (e.g. 6546) for my MythTV frontend.  For standard MythTV controls, I've found a list at <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Frontend_control_socket">http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Frontend_control_socket</a>, which would use a command syntax like '# jump livetv'.  For a more custom solution, what kind of syntax would I use to send a command that calls the Python script, perhaps named AVControl.py, and include a parameter value like TV_Vol_Up?  The parameter value would be based on a list of custom values configured in my Python script that correlates to the appropriate serial command to be sent to the appropriate component.</p>

<p>I know this may be complex, but the last piece to my puzzle seems to be the syntax for running a script remotely via a TCP/IP command sent from the Controller.  I know I could use something dedicated like a GlobalCache iTach device, but I'd rather not purchase additional hardware when my MythTV frontend would work just fine (my wife would also prefer I not purchase more hardware).  Also, I could then use RS232, which provides more stability than IR.</p>

<p>Your help is appreciated!</p>

<p>Not sure I follow entirely what you're trying to do &#8211; for using RS232 from the controller, there's a couple of protocol implementations already that do this, mainly Russound I believe and also X10 with CM11A are based on RS232 integration.</p>

<p>For executing a python from within controller, Java virtual machine does give you some access to the environment to execute commands, this is how we execute LIRC commands from controller, for example.</p>

<p>So if those are were the kinds of things you were looking for, then that might be the direction to go to (I don't know the details of MythTV, I think Marcus Redeker is playing with it though. Maybe Torbj√∂rn as well).</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Sorry if I wasn't too clear on my design intentions.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I did some additional research on my Samsung TV, and it can't be controlled via RS232. Rather, it has a 3.5mm service jack that utilizes the same type of capability as RS232.  However, it can't be powered on using this port.</p>

<p>At this point I think I'll go the route of using a Global Cache iTach IP2IR.  I would've liked using RS232, but this route seems more straightforward.  Plus, I saw someone else posted how to send commands to the iTach via OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input, though!</p></font>
