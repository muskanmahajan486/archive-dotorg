So hopefully this is directly usable with the existing HTTP protocol implementation in OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Would like to hear back from anyone who has access to the unit and whether they've had success with the HTTP interface?</p>

After some discussion it appeared to be different however. The software and the documentation is not yet complete and stable. In principle it looks a promising device. The HTTP communication is a bit more low level than I first anticipated. You don't get a status value with one single http call. You first have to request it, next you ask for a value.<br/>
If they guarantee that it works with Danfoss Living Connect I'll buy the Razzberry. I do have a Pi hanging around here.<br/>
Until then I'll be watching their space.<br/>
