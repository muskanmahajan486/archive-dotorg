<p>This looks interest but I have to wonder how much bandwidth this will consume? Is it large packet (like 1500 byte) or small packet (64 byte) traffic? 100M or 1G? A good switch will probably have no problem with a couple of sessions. I'm not too worried about the price as I expect it will come down (yes, I know the Pound is a larger amount than the Dollar). I can see this being a major problem with wireless (even N) as the spectrum fills (and it's flooding quickly). I'd also like to know about its packet latency. These are things that are very important in network (yes it's what I do for a living).</p></font>

<p>Actually I hope to get a nice new TV in February.</p>

<p>I'd still like to know about the latency and packet size. I did notice after my post that the Cisco 2960 is setup for VLAN, as suggested by the picture. the Cisco 2960 can switch 3 - 10 million packets/sec, usually 1500 byte packets. I'm not sure you can get Cisco''s routing software on that switch. Smart idea to keep the traffic segregated.</p></font>

<p>I assume you have used one of these?&nbsp; The 2G or 1G.&nbsp; I am about to purchase one and have not heard much.&nbsp; But I very interested deploying a few on a 3com gbit network with some extreme fiber distances, poe end points.&nbsp; Just spoke to these guys today...&nbsp;&nbsp; You knnow of any other options?</p></font>

Typically two dedicated pieces of CAT-5e cable is needed for this end-to-end. Quite likely you would also want ethernet so you would need to plan for an installation with three rounds of CAT-5 cabling for this to work.</p>


<p>There are several solutions for this around, mine is from Koenig. Works with good and reliable image quality up to 1080p. </p></font>
