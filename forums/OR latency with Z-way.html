				    <p>Hi,<br/>
I've been using Openremote with Z-way (from z-ware.me) on raspberry for more than a year without a hitch. The system was updated several times and now runs OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.2, and z-way-server_2014-07-19-08-33-48. The openremote switches are all implemented using http protocol, pointing to the raspberry that holds the z-way server. For instance</p>

<p><a href="http://10.0.0.3:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices%5B5%5D.instances%5B0%5D.commandClasses%5B0x26%5D.Set%28255%29">http://10.0.0.3:8083/ZWaveAPI/Run/devices%5B5%5D.instances%5B0%5D.commandClasses%5B0x26%5D.Set%28255%29</a></p>

<p>It uses to work like a charm.</p>

<p>Sometimes ago I noticed that the response time of the OpenRemote switches associated with z-ware actuators became slower and slower. The exact symptom is that every now and then one command takes up to 20 seconds to apply (for instance light up a light from the Openremote interface). This happens mostly randomly, but it is more likely when I issue several commands in a row (like switching three lights off, the third takes 20 secs to switch off). </p>

<p>To debug I've tried several things and I can say that:<br/>
1) When the command issued by openremote switch is sent by firefox, also several times in a few seconds, not problem arises.<br/>
2) z-way web interface shows no problem, as I can switch stuff on and off very quickly from there.<br/>
3) If openremote and z-way are on the same raspberry or on two different raspberries the problem is the same.<br/>
4) No error is shown in the openremote logs or in z-way logs.<br/>
5) The problem arises also when I issue (say) three commands, 2 of which are not related with z-way (for instance two switches for starting a rule). OR waits for the z-way related command to finish before executing the other rules.<br/>
I really tried hard to solve this independently, but I did not succeed. Any hint on where to look?<br/>
thank you <br/>

<p>after some more debugging I was able to pinpoint the moment when the communication between OR and Z-way gets stuck. Right after the 10/20 secs of halt I'm experiencing, I see this in the dev.log. When the command is executed with no delay, these messages do not appear.</p>

<p>This is run on a test system with only three switches. Any idea?<br/>
