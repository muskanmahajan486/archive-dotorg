				    <p>Was there any work done to compile openremote controller to native app for a given system, e.g. using GCJ? </p>

<p>Beside that some people asked me this explicitly during IoTworld2015 (and I was not sure), the other benefit would be that it could be run possibly on systems with less resources as this path should create smaller footprint. I'm investigating now the feasibility to run Openremote along with openwrt and possibility to run it on openwrt hardware like Linksys WRT1900AC router. Is there anything done in this direction?</p>

<p>I suppose there might be some challenges with the current code base such as use of Spring and Tomcat.<br/>
Some of the work on the roadmap, such as making the OR controller not dependent on Tomcat (and thus getting the admin Web UI out of the controller) would help a lot.</p></font>
