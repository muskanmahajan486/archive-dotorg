				    <p>I spent a couple hours tonight designing a couple new panels for my remote, saved multiple times and deployed to the controller multiple times. They are live on the controller and in use on one of my remotes, however I logged back into the designer a little bit ago and it is in the state it was earlier this evening prior to my work. Any suggestions on how this may have happened, and if there is any way of exporting from the controller back into the designer so I don't have to manually rebuild the panels? </p>

<p>As a side note the devices/sensors I built all appear to be there still, just the panels have reverted back. </p>
