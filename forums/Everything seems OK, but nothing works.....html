				    <p>Hi</p>

<p>Probably a silly question but please forgive.</p>

<p>I have installed OR on a RaspberryPi running Wheezy.</p>

<p>Everything looks OK. I can design panels, add devices, open 192......60:8080/controller, sync controller to web, open app on iPad/iPhone which finds and loads controller, touch the buttons but nothing happens.</p>

<p>There were no unexpected messages during install. JRE6 is in place.</p>

<p>I started trying to control RaspBMC on another Pi but was unable to tell which bit was not working.</p>

<p>So I cut back to a single button invoking "Shell execution Protocol" pointing to "/home/pi/testfile.sh" containing 'date +"%H-%M-%S" &gt;&gt; outfile'.</p>

<p>If I run this from a local terminal or execute "ssh pi@192......60 /home/pi/testfile.sh" from elsewhere it works - current time is appended to /home/pi/outfile.</p>

<p>But the button does nothing (except blink).</p>

<p>I have done this again on Ubuntu 12.04 laptop with exactly the same results.</p>

<p>Obviously I am missing something....</p>

<p>Any advice as to what to try next would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>catalina.out is rather large and contains </p>

<p>191 is the iPad.</p>

<p>Since there seems to be no time info I can't say whether these errors happened early on as I was stumbling through the design process by trial and error, or later when I had what seemed to be a complete (but not functioning) system.</p>

<p>Unless the fault is immediately apparent maybe I should remove OR, delete all devices and panels in designer, rebuild the simple system, load the controller and press the button once, and maybe the number of ERRORs and file size will be more manageable? </p></font>
