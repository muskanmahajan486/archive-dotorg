                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I gather from your other post that you're talking about adding this to the iOS console.</p>

<p>I don't think it's really easy to do but all depends on your level of expertise in iOS and C development.</p>

<p>The iOS SDK does not support RTSP out of the box, so you need to find and compile a library to provide that service.<br/>
This bit should still be OK. If you want to contribute code back to OR, you however need to be careful on the licenses of the libraries you choose.<br/>
Juha is the expert on this, but anything Apache, MIT or LGPL should be OK.</p>

<p>But this is only the transport layer, now you need to decode and present the video.<br/>
I would take it that the video is H264, which is the most probable format.<br/>
Until now (that is up to iOS 7.1), Apple did not expose access to the hardware decoder, which meant that you need to do the decoding in software, using a library like ffmpeg.<br/>
I did look at that a very long time ago, but it turned out to be too slow for our application (it was on an iPhone 3G) and I never took it any further.</p>

<p>If you're happy with iOS 8 only support, then you can take advantage of the new API.<br/>
There is a specific WWDC session on this topic, for which you can find the video on Apple's dev site.</p>

<p>If you get that part running, which is totally independent of OpenRemote, the rest is pretty simple to do.<br/>
It'll need some thoughts on how to integrate within OR but there we can help and there should not be any technical difficulties.</p>

<p>I would thus advice, if you want to add this, to code a simple iOS app to display the video from your camera.<br/>
This will avoid you the need to look at OR code and deal with any issues that might arise there.<br/>
Once you're there, then we can see how to integrate.</p>

<p>Hope this gives you a better idea on the way forward.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Before I focus the openremote project , I made a own platform to access the IPC, which like the dropcam's usage. In the iOS client , I use the VLCKit for support rtsp protocol and the H.264 decoder. And I use the libvlc in the Android platform for support the IPC . The vlc library is good for it. The vlc use the the live555 and ffmpeg library support it.</p>

<p>But I don't know much about the openremote architecture,I will study it then consider how to integrate the client and the platform .</p></font>
