<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm an experienced Java/Web/Tomcat programmer, but an absolute newbie just starting to read into home automation.  I'd like to ask for some high-level advice and documentation pointers for what I'd like to start with.  I'll try to be succinct:</p>

<p>Main home: 120 yrs old, partially brought into the modern world. Has Comcast cable and an older but healthy linux box running Centos 5.  Needs: remote environment sensing: temperature and a basement water sensor.</p>

<p>Vacation home: basically new; has Wild Blue satellite internet service.  No permanently installed system to act as server at present, but plan to add something as needed.  Similar needs: remote environment sensing: temperature and several in-house water sensors (no basement).</p>

<p>My main working box (goes everywhere with me):  a MacBook Pro; has Java 6 (Apple) &amp; Tomcat 6.0.29 for development.</p>

<p>Goals: A system running on my MacBook which will always allow me to check up on the "other" house; i.e., support reporting on the two locations at any time.</p>

<p>Basic question: will OpenRemote support such a "dual" system?  <div class="error"><span class="error">Unknown macro: {While I can&#39;t imagine this is a new idea, I&#39;m still prepared to do some serious programming to achieve it.}</span> </div></p>

<p>I'm also interested in recommendations for hardware:  basic OpenRemote interfaces as well as temperature and water sensors.</p>

<p>Wrt documentation, are there any good general home automation articles or tutorials to be recommended, and then the same for OpenRemote?</p>

<p>Thanks very much in advance,<br/>
Ken Bowen</p>

welcome to OpenRemote. Our upcoming 2.0 release will support 1-wire sensors which are great for temp and humidity.<br/>
What kind of water sensor are you looking for? Do you want to detect leakage? <br/>
We support as many setups as you wish <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> You just need a small box (Java and Tomcat cabable) running with the OpenRemote controller on and internet access to be able to connect to it.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Marcus,</p>

<p>The water sensors I want need to be simple leakage sensors: Did the water heater spring a leak? Did the connector to a toilet spring a leak? (Been there...), etc.  For temperature sensing, I could get away with a simple range detection: has the temp gotten below ABC degrees?  </p>

<p>Do you have a time frame for the 2.0 release?  I've got a lot of claims on my time, but I do want to move this forward.  Maybe I'll build it from SVN to start playing around.  Is there anything complex to the build?  I'm used to moderately complicated open source java stuff, but it's been nice that the last couple have been very straight-forward: get the source tree (either from svn or a tar ball), make sure all the libraries are present, and say "ant".  Then I suck it up into Eclipse and start trying to understand...</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
Ken</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Ken,</p>

<p>you can build the upcoming release from SVN using the branch "/branches/project/Controller_2_0_0_Alphas". <br/>
We currently do not have a time frame for the release.</p>

<p>For temp sensors 1-wire should be ok, I don't know any 1-wire sensos for leakage. I found (quick google search) some leakage sensors which work with 1-wire switching, but I don't know if the current 1-wire code does support this in the moment. Also I found some ethernet leakage detectors which could be used with OpenRemote since we support TCP/IP communication.</p>

<p>Thanks.  I'll give the build a try when I get back to home base in a couple of weeks.</p>
