				    <p>All,</p>

<p>I just found your project mentioned on the knx-user-forum in germany. I am a java consultant and developer who has over 10 years of java experience. I initiated the JBoss OpenTool for JBuilder in the "old days" and also did some JBoss contributions. Recently I started my own business and one aspect of my work is home automation. In the moment I am planning my KNX installation and will attend a KNX seminar and certification this summer.</p>

<p>In the moment I am using a Nokia N800 which is Linux based and the irreco project (<a href="http://irreco.garage.maemo.org/">http://irreco.garage.maemo.org/</a>). For infrared control I am using a irtrans module which should be great for openremote too because it is compatible with lirc (<a href="http://www.irtrans.de/en/">http://www.irtrans.de/en/</a>).</p>

<p>I also want to use my iPhone todo some stuff and currently look into Xcode and COCOA.</p>

<p>Another interesting project you might want to look at is iKNX for the iPhone. (<a href="http://www.iknx.de/iKNX_english/Home.html">http://www.iknx.de/iKNX_english/Home.html</a>)</p>

<p>Do you see some correlation with Linux MCE? (<a href="http://www.linuxmce.com/">http://www.linuxmce.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Let me know how I can help? Is it possible to install some parts of openremote already on a Linux pc?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Marcus,</p>

<p>JBoss + KNX, getting better and better <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I've looked at IRTrans before and it looked very cool. I didn't realize it already does LIRC, somehow I missed that on their website, otherwise I would have jumped at it already.</p>

<p>So I guess I need to get one now. Sounds like you like it, what is the pricing like? If I recall, it wasn't exactly cheap (but everything's relative).</p>

<p>We do like iKNX a lot! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> More about that soon....</p>

<p>LinuxMCE, related for sure. I can't really decide what to make of it, there's alot of conflicting reports from people whether they like it or not. I haven't had a chance to try it myself. Have you used it? Anything to share there?</p>

<p>Re: help &#8211; need to organize efforts, I quickly pointed a couple earlier, see <a href="http://community.openremote.org/display/forums/I%27m+in?focusedCommentId=1966139#comment-1966139">this other thread</a>.</p>

<p>Another that just came up with my response to Dray (this is a larger project) is to put together an interface to script serial (and IP) interfaces, could be command line first (via REST to controller) and later a fancier (web?) interface with a scripting language. Basically to manage input/output through RS232 to control arbitrary protocols and devices with programmer's interface. This is something that most likely needs a bit of both Java (REST etc) and C (serial) knowledge (altough RXTX might be an option at least for the quick prototype).</p>

<p>Anyway, much is up for grabs. Feel free to ask questions for direction either here on the forums, chat, or even email directly.</p>

<p>Hmm.. more JBossers, will drive Neil nuts!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>&#8211; Juha</p>

<p>Yes do get your KNX cert, I did that in sept and there is a lot there to learn. It really focused my mind on the issues in automation and the business side of things.&nbsp; As juha mentioned do stay tuned more about iKNX soon... <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Juha has got a lot of it running on a linux PC and this is a good way to do an end to end solution.&nbsp; For KNX we may not need a PC just the iphone since there is a connection through IP.</p>

<p>So our focus is on the modeller that enables you to assemble the interfaces.&nbsp; IN a couple of weeks we can focus on specifics... good to have you around&#33;</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Juha,</p>

<p>I looked at the other thread and saw the link to svn on sf. I will take a look at checkout the source but from browsing the repo I already saw that you like iKNX <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Currently I have the irtrans ethernet module with included database. The website says that it is going for 175â‚¬ in the moment. This comes with a LIRC compatible software daemon which I have running on my Linux server. That server also has 2 build-in TV capture cards and a mythtv server is running. For watching videos and recorded tv shows I use 2 S100 streaming boxes (<a href="http://wiki.zenega-user.de/index.php?title=S100">http://wiki.zenega-user.de/index.php?title=S100</a>) which remote boot linux from the server and run the mythtv client.</p>

<p>I once tried to install LinuxMCE but that was a beta version from when they just started and I had some problems. No more investigation until now.</p>

<p>Is it possible to test with my iPhone and irtrans module already? Let me know how I can install.</p>


<p>I also have a LCD TV which includes a serial interface. So I might be up for some RS232 work. I will need a ethernet&lt;-&gt;rs232 converter for this because I only have LAN where the TV is. Do you know of a good converter? Although, when using the converter I can probably just open a socket and send the command and there is no real serial communication going on on the java side. I will take a look at that.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Marc,</p>

<p>good to hear from you. My focus is to try to do eveyrthing with IP. Thats why my irtrans module is the one with the ethernet interface. Using irreco which I mentioned above it works pretty well. irreco also includes a modeller to assemble the interface which already supports themes and images.</p>

<p>These days all kind of new devices come with WLAN or LAN support (eg. amplifiers, tv). A lot of these can probably be controlled directly from the iPhone. It is interesting to see where the journey will end. I also play around with upnp av but this is all not stable enough yet.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Is it possible to test with my iPhone and irtrans module already? Let me know how I can install.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the moment we send IR directly to LIRC. It's however just a delegation to LIRC's irsend command via Java's ProcessBuilder. Search for IRCommander.java in Controller tree.</p>

<p>So basically you'd need to hack that to talk to the IRTrans software daemon (if I understood you correctly) that translates to socket and IP for your IRTrans unit. There's a "Commander" class to extend for this. I'm working through these same steps as we speak myself as well.</p>

<p>That would get you to the point where you can poke the controller with a very simple REST command to trigger an event (see <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/Controller+API+Documentation" title="Controller API Documentation">Controller API Documentation</a>). Your controller will also need a controller.xml that maps the incoming REST cmd paramter (numbers 1,2,3 etc) to an event that will direct to the "Commander" class.</p>

<p>So still some hacking required (but we haven't released yet so...)</p>

<p>For iPhone, we are waiting to get an account on App Store to distribute the basic app. Things are finally moving a bit on that front (Apple reacting) so I am hopeful... (if you have an account you could try to compile and install the iphone app yourself I suppose, I still need to work out the details there)</p>

<p>TV with serial is a luxury! Very interesting. Sorry can't help with the converter.</p>

<p>Would you mind sharing your TV model and make, might be interesting to start collecting info in knowledgebase about "controllable" TVs. Let us know if you do serial work on it, would be very interested indeed.</p></font>

<p>Would you mind sharing your TV model and make, might be interesting to start collecting info in knowledgebase about "controllable" TVs. Let us know if you do serial work on it, would be very interested indeed.</p></blockquote>I created a knowledgebase entry for controllable device. Just added my TV for now. Can be extended anytime. I know of plenty of devices e.g. Samsung LCD, Yamaha or Onkyo AV-AMPs, Russound, ... which support this.</p>

<p>For the serial converter I just ordered this (<a href="http://www.korenix.com/jetport-device-server-5201-overview.htm">http://www.korenix.com/jetport-device-server-5201-overview.htm</a>) from a distributor in germany. It cost around 100â‚¬. So I will try and build something to control the TV with java. We can discuss a general scripting solution when I have some results.</p>

<p>Since I have two mythtv clients it would be nice to control those also. Mythtv already comes with a control interface based on telnet. It would be nice if OR also supports telnet to control devices. Here it would probably make sense to also have some kind of scripting available to define the commands.</p></font>

There is no IRCommander.java in Controller tree but there is a IREvent and IREventBuilder. I will create a new IRtransEvent and hack the builder to create that. That should do it for now. The IRtransEvent will talk to my irtrans box.</p>

<p>I ordered the RS232 converter today. So I will also take a look at that and create a protocol for that. The question is if there should be a differentiation between RS232 connected to a 'real' serial port of the orb or RS232 over ethernet.</p>

<p>Do you guys know how I can get the iPhone app installed on my iPhone? It is jailbreaked but Xcode is complaining about a certificate.</p></font>

<p>@Juha: I was thinking of creating a socketEvent which can be used to send command to all devices that are connected through LAN. This could be my irtrans, my rsr232 lan box and my mythtv client. What do you think? Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Maybe we can skype one day?</p></font>

<p>Yes, I do think a generic (IP) socket event does make sense. There's actually various variants I can foresee where this branches out but those can be discussed later. But having a generic socket event is one of the first steps to providing a scripting interface to device-specific implementations that follow no particular standard.</p>
