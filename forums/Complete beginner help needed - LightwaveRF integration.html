				    <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I'm a complete beginner with this and could really do with some help - in the past I've managed to teach myself basic DOS shell and VB scripts and Business Object stuff, but I'm at a complete loss with this! Apologies if this is covered in tutorials anywhere, but I've found them to be a bit confusingly organised and haven't learned much from what I've read so far.</p>

<p>I have a few LightwaveRF light switches and plug sockets (plus the control box), and I'm trying to build a simple interface to start with, just to switch them on and off. So far, I've learned that the protocol to connect with these is UDP, but that's as far as I've got. I've added a button to a panel in the Designer, but after that I'm at a complete loss as to what to do next. I've clicked the Command button, which presents me with 2 folders (Devices and Macros, which are both empty when I try to expand them), and I've had a look in the Config for Controller section of the Building Modeler but so far come up with nothing that looks like what I think I need.</p>

<p>It looks like I need to be at the point where I can edit the commands, as in the screenshot here <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/LightwaveRF%2C+UDP+and+UDP+Listener+help?focusedCommentId=21858096#comment-21858096">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/LightwaveRF%2C+UDP+and+UDP+Listener+help?focusedCommentId=21858096#comment-21858096</a></p>

<p>Am I missing something blindingly obvious? I really want to learn and experiment as much as I can with this, and it's a bit disheartening being stuck this early on - I'd really appreciate some beginner steps to get a few rudimentary buttons working. I've tried looking in the Public Templates folder for inspiration but that seems to be empty too.</p>

<p>I'd also like to get OR running on my NAS (Western Digital LiveBook) - is that easy?</p>

<p>Sorry for all the questions and long first post - it looks like you don't get many complete newbies around here though, hopefully the answers to my questions could help others in future <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Just like to say that you are not alone! I am pretty much stuck at the same point and was asking myself as well: What is it that I do not see that must be obvious to others?</p>

<p>I got OR running on my NAS (Synology DS 213) a few days ago. Not really easy but doable, with some trial and error. <br/>
Watch your typing! Linux is case sensitive, as I have found out the hard way. When copying lines from the tutorials, every typo matters and not all tutorials are easy to follow without a linux background.</p>

<p>Sorry that I can not really help, but I could need some help as well.<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Hans,</p>

<p>Glad I'm not the only one!</p>

<p>I've managed to get a bit further forward, I don't know how far you managed to get but if you were as stuck as me, this may be of some help:</p>

<p>To create a button and get to the point where you can edit the command assigned to it, you will first need to be in Building Modeler.<br/>
New &gt; New Device<br/>
Name, Vendor and Model - type anything you want here (I went with Home Test, Pete and Test) &gt; Next<br/>
Add command<br/>
Name - anything you like (I chose HallLightsOn), Protocol - UDP</p>

<p>IP address - the IP address of your LightwaveRF box<br/>
Port - the port it receives commands on (I think it's 9760)<br/>
Command - this is where you'd put the coded command. Apparently the format goes R1D1F0 (where R1 is the room number, D1 is the device, and F0 (zero) is off and F1 is on) - taken from a forum post here - <a href="http://lightwaverfcommunity.org.uk/forums/topic/wifi-link-api/">http://lightwaverfcommunity.org.uk/forums/topic/wifi-link-api/</a></p>

<p>I've not yet been able to make this work though, and have seen several variations on the format of the command code. In the post I linked to above, Martyn posts a screenshot with the code he says works for him (null|000,&#33;R1D1F1\r), but I can't make that do anything!</p>

<p>I feel like I'm close to getting started, and once I can make the first light turn off I'll be up and away, but so this is as far as I've got so far.</p>

<p>Hope you've had better luck than me!</p></font>

<p>Have not heard anyone doing that yet, so "easy" is probably not what it will be. More like jumping into the dark pool of water without seeing what's below the surface.</p>

<p>However, if you do make the jump, and come back with a success, we'd be happy to include the WD as another NAS we can support if you care to document the steps.</p>

<p>Looks like you managed to climb the mountain on this one.</p>

<p>It might be helpful if the steps are documented for the next person, from a newcomer's perspective is fine. If interested, let me know and I can set up a wiki page for you.</p>
