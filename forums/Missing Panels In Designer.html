				    <p>In my setup I currently have two panels, one for me and the other for my girlfriend.  I have deployed both panels to my controller and have loaded each to their respective device without issue.  The problem arises when I stop working in designer for the day.  When I come back the next day the second panel (for GF) has disappeared!  I don't know what's going on.  Has anyone heard of this happening?  </p>
