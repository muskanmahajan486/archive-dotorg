				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I was making a REST service to add the possibility to create commands that can save data to a Mysql database.<br/>
I decided to do it with a REST interface after having too many problems with the Shell execution protocol but is seems that the http calls don't work as they should either.<br/>
POST and PUT don't work, only GET seems to do what it should (I didn't try DELETE yet)<br/>
I was able to work around this by adapting my REST server but I thought I'd let y'all know...</p>

Request not sent ? Is the wrong HTTP verb used ? Wrong headers ? Issue with payload ?</p></font>

I saw other users on the forum having problems with the HTTP post, propably the issue was the missing Content-Type field as was also the problem here: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22882841&amp;focusedCommentId=22883212#comment-22883212">http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22882841&amp;focusedCommentId=22883212#comment-22883212</a></p></font>
