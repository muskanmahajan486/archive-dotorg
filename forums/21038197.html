				    <p>I am a technical minded person, but I wonder if I have the time to become a programmer to use OR. Is it a product that a non-programmer could use, or is it something that only someone with oodles of time and a desire to spend weeks of nights trying to make it work will be able to use? <br/>
Is it something my wife can use, or is it going to be one of those things she is going to get angry about and tell me to get rid of it all? <br/>
Is there a "Setting up OR for dummies" guide? <br/>
She is not necessarily the dummy. It's probably me. Heh! <br/>
Is OR a stable product? Can I depend upon it to just work, once setup, or will I be mucking about with code once a week wondering why things aren't working? </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>So that's what WAF meant. Heh! <br/>
We are basically after a lighting control/HVAC control/media control system that may or may not incorporate an alarm. It should be capable of locking and unlocking doors, reading status of same doors (locked, unlocked, open, closed) and all should be able to be viewed or states changed using either a tablet on WiFi or with smart phones. Ideally we would be able to incorporate some basic media controls as well, so we can use the tablet to control all the bits for watching movies or streaming music ala Pandora too. <br/>
I have been becoming familiar with different locks and other gadgets, and it would be great to incorporate them. For example, the Kwikset keypad lock with either Zwave or Zigbee, the fancy thermostat Nest, and either some Lutron or similar switches that we can control wirelessly using scenes or macros. <br/>
Basic daily function would be turning on some exterior lights when it's dark, turning down LR lights, dropping screen, turning on projector, selecting source on stereo. </p>

If some money is not a limiting factor, I would consider something like Micasaverde as a solution to do the basic management and control for HVAC. An alternative might be the Fibaro HC. Both offer 24/7 dedicated control of your devices. Each has its own advantages. The Micasaverde seems to be the more open platform. I have seen some people on this forum discussing interaction with the Micasaverde with OpenRemote. </p>

<p>At the moment support for Z-Wave directly from OR is limited. Zigbee is not yet supported as far as I know. So Micasaverde could fill that gap if your choice were Z-Wave. I don't know if they already support the recently released locks. Do check their website<br/>
I think there is plenty of experience here of controlling audio/visual things with OpenRemote. The charm of OR is that it is in principle agnostic about what it controls. You can control devices directly or via a dedicated controller if that controller is sufficiently open.<br/>
Bear in mind that you should design your system such that it still can work if your automation controls are down.<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>      As a three day old newbie, I've concluded that Open Remote (OR) is an incredibly powerful and elegant system...but the documentation is really awful.  Don't get me wrong...it's all there, but figuring everything out is like playing an adventure game.  Rather than just whine, I do have a suggestion that I think could improve things immeasurably; a comprehensive Table of Contents.</p>

<p>     I've been using X10 modules for years, and decided to use a recently purchased Raspberry Pi as a dedicated controller for this purpose.  I stumbled onto OR as a possible vehicle for this, and since I'm more conversant with Windows than Linux, opted to first install the controller on a laptop running Windows 7.  Using my Android tablet, I just successfully rang the chime that indicates that my cat wants to come inside, and decided to share my thoughts with other potential newbies.</p>

<p>    First...yes, X10 works just fine, and is very easy to set up.... once you've cracked the code.  I have both the CM11A and the CM15A, but opted to use the CM11A because it seems simpler for programs to handle.  I haven't bought a computer in years that had a serial port, but serial to USB adapters are really cheap, and Windows 7 has no problems findings drivers for them; plug it in, after it grinds for a while, it reports that it is successfully installed, and tells you what COMM port it looks like to the computer.  It may not be this simple with Linux...but I'm sure I can figure it out.  Enter this into the config.properties file, and that's it...the controller works fine with it.  Where is the config.properties file?  The location is defined in the X10 section...at least where it is on a Linux system...but I missed that for a while.  I guess the minimum competence level required is knowing that the Linux "/" is the Windows "\;" if you don't realize that, you're probably in for some tough sledding.</p>

<p>     In my experience, software/system designers are the wrong people to be writing manuals; they assume a level of experience the vast majority of potential users don't possess.  They also often use jargon very familiar to the mavens, but patently unfamiliar to newbies.  For example; long-time Windows users are accustomed to installing programs in the "Program Files" directory, so that's where I installed OR.  Heeding the warning to not use a name with spaces in it, I figured all would be well if I used the directory name "OpenRemote;" no spaces.  After flailing for three hours, I noticed in one of Marcus Redeker's posts a screen capture that showed that he had installed it in the root directory; I moved it, and voila, it worked.  Yes, the documentation was correct, "Program Files" has a space in it and won't work...stupid me.  But if the documentation simply recommended installing it in the root directory, and included the caveat that the ENTIRE path name must contain no spaces, then the people that decide to deviate from the recommended installation would be the ones flailing.</p>

<p>     I realize that since OR runs on so many platforms and can do so many things, that a simple "Getting Started" might be a challenge, since different users will be interested in their own subset of the system's capabilities.  I could write a very simple "How To" section for people wanting to set up an X10 system on a Windows 7 computer, for example, but it would be worthless unless that was the exact application of interest.</p>

<p>     Also, operating at the command prompt level in Windows might be beyond the typical potential user, but a simple cmd level tutorial could solve that.  After screwing with the Raspberry Pi, and then opening the cmd window in Windows, I typed "ls" to see what files were present, and saw the "Invalid command" message.  Oh yeah, "cd" is "cd," but "ls" is "dir."</p>

<p>    As I mentioned at the outset of this admittedly lengthy post, I recommend developing a comprehensive Table of Contents that would simply be an organized set of links to the already existing documentation.  Over the past few days, I can't count the times I've said to myself, "Now where did I see that described," and then had to perform a search to find it again.  (Oh, I need an ax to kill the troll...I know I saw one, but which room was it in???)</p>

<p>     And now, since I'm about to tackle the next challenge...a "rules" primer would also be nice.  The cat bell needs to chime when the cat wants in, not when I press a button on the tablet.</p>

<p>     To everyone who has been responsible for developing and supporting OR thus far...congratulations on creating such an amazing system!</p></font>

<p>I've got:</p>

<p>Micasaverde Vera Light with UI5<br/>
54 sensors<br/>
XBMC Media Setup<br/>
Ademco/Honeywell Vista 20p Alarm system</p>

<p>...all work pretty well together.  I will warn you of this though; BASIC Vera functionality is easy to achieve out of the box.  More advanced features will take you about a month to get familiar with and work out.  Yes it needed some LUA code too which I have learned a little bit of.  You'll need that to help you through.  However, don't let that frighten you, the user support on the forums is great and there are examples which you can use as base code to get the more advanced features to work.  I'm not sure calling them advanced features is fair though, what I wanted to do was relatively simple but unfortunately the capability didn't exist without code.  Example, I wanted my lights to come on at 60% brightness when the door was opened AND the light sensor read a certain value.  I then wanted the lights to come on to 100% brightness when the door was opened AND the light sensor read a different value.  Seems like a simple request to me but required a short LUA code to get it to work which took some time to get right.  I'll also mention that sometimes it does jam up and take a minute or two to do what you've asked of it but as the problem has not been isolated, it's difficult to say for sure what's causing it. </p>

<p>Moving on, OR works really well to control the Vera.  Granted at present I've only got it controlling lights and appliance modules (not the alarm panel or thermostats just yet)  but it was pretty simple to do.  I'll be doing a write-up on this shortly with pictures and a video to help along.  It took me about 2 days to get familiar with OR and some of its quirks but I can't complain; it works well.  </p>

<p>I'm sure a few people share the frustrations with the documentation and such but I personally would rather the developers continue to develop this fantastic remote and rely on people like you and I to contribute in writing the documentation?  I see that as being part of the solution.</p>

<p>You've got vaild points, why not help the system out with the benefit of your contribution.  After all, the system is free (which to be honest I find amazing and I am soooo thankful for!).  It's a similar concept with the XBMC community.  A shed load of developers very kindly putting in the effort and getting the app where it should be and the user community supporting by updating/creating documentation.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>   Thanks for the reply Latz.  I suppose you're right...if the developers kept stopping to spiff up the documentation, OR probably wouldn't be where it is today.  I plan to put together a more comprehensive description of how to install OR on Windows 7 with a CM11A when I get a little farther along.  Ultimately I'll put the OR controller on a Raspberry Pi, but that will be after I get it working the way I want on Windows.  And since the Windows computer I installed it on is not the Windows computer where it needs to be...I can memorialize the Windows process as I load it onto the next Windows computer (I loaded it on a laptop first, so I could sit in a comfortable chair and watch football games over the weekend; the house server that runs 24/7 is in a room with no TV...or comfortable chair).</p>

<p>   Right now I'm stuck getting the controller to recognize that the motion detector has detected motion.  I thought my challenge would be figuring out how to write the rules, but the examples already posted have enough info to make that seem not too complicated.  I decided not to tackle two problems simultaneously...handling the motion detector and writing rules...so I'm trying to get the status of the motion detector displayed on a label field on my tablet...but thus far haven't succeeded.  I'm sure it's a matter of defining things properly in the setup...but haven't cracked the code yet.  </p>

<p>    If you...or anyone...knows how to define the device parameters so a sensor can recognize the status of the motion detector, I'd appreciate a clue.  With X10, a motion sensor has a house and unit address just like the lamp and appliance modules, and reports "On" when motion is detected, and after staying on for a while, then reverts to the "Off" state.  Maybe this requires a custom level definition, but I'm not sure.  Looking at the DevLog file, the sensor input is being reported as "null," and I'm not sure yet if that's the "off" state, or the fact that I don't have everything set up properly.  As I was falling asleep last night, I decided I needed to create motion, and look in the log file and see if anything different was being reported...but haven't had a chance to try it yet.</p>

<p>    I agree with you...OR is an amazing system; the difficulty in setting it up is a direct result of how flexible it is; that's life. </p>

<p>Haha I can agree I would do the same with the comfy chair! I have a home server on 24/7 too, it's running Windows Server so I use an RDP session to it.  That way I can use my laptop to do the work on the server <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I'm having troubles with getting a switch status to change on a HTTP GET request <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Sounds like our problem is a similar one.  I've posted a question on it, but no replies as yet!  Oh well, I'll keep plugging away in the hope I get an answer and if I do I'll share it with you!</p>

<p>All the best </p>

    I'm stuck, so I tried to add a topic for "X10 Motion Sensors," and included what I had done and what the dev log file showed.  But I can't find my post.  I typed the title in the block at the top that says "New Page," maybe that's not where the title of the post goes.  Or is there a delay before new topics show up?</p>

<p>     Too windy today to work on the barn dis-assembly; removing large metal sheets from the roof would have been a stupid idea.  Maybe tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hmmm; I just noticed that the button below this reply is "Post," while the button below the new topic I tried to add says "Save."  Does "Save" equal "Post," or did I not complete the process?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
    Tom</p></font>

<p>Not entirely sure on the save and post questions but if you check in your profile you may find it there under a tab called 'Watches'.</p>

<p>When logged into the forum home page, click on your name (which should be at the top of the page), select 'My profile'and have a look for the 'Watches'tab under there.</p>

<p>Failing that, it may be under a tab called 'Drafts'.</p>
