				    <p>First of all, thanks for developing this.  It's the best interface I've seen yet.  It's fairly simple and the documentation with screenshots are great!  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it stable yet.  Hopefully my input would help.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Bugs</p>

<p>1.  Designer errors when trying to save while designing screens using Google Chrome.  This appears to be some sort of timeout issue.  This doesn't appear to happen in IE 9.</p>

<p>2.  I tried setting up connections to my thermostat (3M-50), then using JSON to get the results.  </p>

<p>3.  When working on Designer, your screens would sometimes disappear and seem to revert back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>4.  Sometimes, when you click on an existing screen, it doesn't show the template (Iphone...)</p>

<p>5.  Restarting Iphone app shows error: "Occured unknown error, status code is 0 Using cached content"  This might be related to some kind of corruption with our design profile.</p>

<p>6.  The remote software doesn't seem to update consistently.  I find myself having to force it to close and reload it (iphone 4s)</p>

<p>Ideas:</p>

<p>1.  I'm concerned that a bunch of sensors using the http protocol might be locking up my 3M-50 thermostat.  A delay upon initialization might help.  </p>

<p>2.  Getting multiple data from 1 http query would make it more efficient.  For instance, this is the result from my thermostat:<br/>
{"temp":69.50,"tmode":1,"fmode":0,"override":0,"hold":0,"t_heat":70.00,"tstate":1,"fstate":0,"time":<div class="error"><span class="error">Unknown macro: {&quot;day&quot;}</span> </div>,"t_type_post":0}</p>

<p>I have to make a sensor and http command to parse each field...</p>
