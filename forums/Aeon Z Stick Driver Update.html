				    <p>I  have just installed open remote controller on a raspberry pi with Debian Wheezy installed  (3.12.28+).<br/>
I want to use z-wave and have an Aeon US Z Stick.<br/>
I have been using your documentation  and got as far as trying to update the CP210x  driver as advised on the Aeotec website.<br/>
I find that the makefile doesn't work because my distribution doesn't have a build directory.<br/>
Cruised the net and tried various solutions including down-loading earlier versions of Linux-headers from 'concrete' packages, but still no joy as now have problems with finding serial USB driver etc.<br/>
I am new to Linux and am struggling with what I had hoped to be a relatively straight forward operation.<br/>
Please help.<br/>
Note that so far open remote looks really good and impressed and just need to get over these hurdles and install this and z wave .</p>
