				    <p>This has now happened to me twice and it's really frustrating....<img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/warning.gif" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Last night I spent a bunch of time working on the online designer only to find that the next day, the work I did is no longer there!!!???</p>

<p>Just to be clear - I have gotten in the habit of saving often, waiting until I get the message saying things are saved, before moving on. (I do this because of having issues in the past.) This is what I did last night.</p>

<p>It's now cost me a bunch of work and looks like I have to redo it all again.</p>


<p>This is VERY Frustrating.</p>


<p>Has anyone else had this happen to them?</p>
