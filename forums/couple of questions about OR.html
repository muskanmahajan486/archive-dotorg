				    <p>A couple of questions.</p>

<p>thinking about using a iguana IR transmitter as a blaster in combination with OpenRemote. Controlling it with a phone/tablet.<br/>
It would also great to control it with a windows/linux client. Are those available?</p>

<p>Although starting a "activity" using a tablet/computer would be cool, i think a real remote control (with physical buttons) are more convenient. I have a Logitech Harmony, but of course does not know in which activity it is when using in combination with OpenRemote. So in the ideal situation we need a device like a harmony but with 2-ways communication.<br/>
The Harmony Link seems to have two-way communication but only with tablets (and not with remotes?).<br/>
I'm afraid i would miss the physical remote. Are there plans to create a remote controller? with for example a little touchscreen (android or linux OS)? Is there something available which can be tweaked to work together with the OR controller?</p>


<p>I'm also searching for more info about Beehive. The on line designer does not include the IR devices i own. Is there some documentation/movie how to add information to Beehive so i can select it?</p>

<p>Also a little question about the "openness" of the project. I've browsed the source a bit. I'm i correct that all source is included? (even the on line designer and the Beehive). Will it be possible to download the content of the Beehive database so i could theoretical recreate the designer-server/beehive at home?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>
