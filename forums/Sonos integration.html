				    <p>Hi I've implemented the Sonos connectivity and have got it working I've hit a few issues:</p>

<p>I use Sonos for internet radio - when I set up a Sonos favourite for a Radio station and call this from OR it does not play - I guess Radio playlists work a bit differently to normal music ones.</p>


<p>I wanted to create a Slider for Volume control.  I've made a Level Sensor which correctly brings back the volume from Sonos.   I then created a http post command using "${param]" as workload.   These then are referenced by the slider.    At the moment the slider responds if I change the volume in Sonos but as soon as I use OR it turns the Volume straight to Zero.  </p>

<p>This seems really close but I can't find anything in the forums that helps.  I've tried using a Range sensor with 0 and 100 min and max.  I've tried GET and PUT for the command.</p>


<p>Finally this is really a nice to have but worth a go!  I wanted to have a dinner bell button which tells sonos to play a playlist (a spotify dinner gong!) which afterwards reverts back to whatever was playing before.  I've got the button working fine but it is the reverting back which is the challenge.   Is there a way perhaps with rules to temporarily hold the playlist in memory?</p>

<p>There's not much documentation on this site yet on this feature. In the Drools documentation you can find all the details if you are able to consume the technical information. There's also an example rule that shows custom facts being declared/inserted/modified on a thread here by Michal Rutka: <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Rule+based+on+time+and+event?focusedCommentId=22877875#comment-22877875">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Rule+based+on+time+and+event?focusedCommentId=22877875#comment-22877875</a></p>
