				    <p>I have a text file which has one line with either "On" or "Off" I want to write a batch file which will<br/>
read this text file and update a sensor </p>

<p>I need help in writing this batch file</p>

<p>can some one give me an example</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I had a look at my last post and I need to explain it better.</p>

<p>I know how to create a batch file to open a text file and read from it</p>

<p>This is my batch file</p>

<p>set /p "var="&lt;"data.txt"<br/>
echo %var%</p>

<p>for /f "delims=" %%a in (data.txt) do set "var=%%a"&amp;goto :stop<br/>
:stop<br/>
echo %var%</p>

<p>If you are running this from the command line it reads "On" from Data.txt and echos on to the display.</p>

<p>I propose to run this batch file using Shell Execution which I have tested and it starts the batch file OK</p>

<p>My question "is echo the correct command to use in order for Openremote to read in the status or should I be using <br/>
some other command"</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Pierce - I don't actually have a Windows machine to experiment with, but I would try a couple of things here...</p>

<p>First, Try to re write your batch file to only need one 'echo' command. OR is probably going to read only one of them - either first or last (unsure of behavior on windows). </p>

<p>Second, make sure your OR Shell Execution command has a regex entered to read back the echoed response. The following should pull back everything <div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">^(.*).*</pre>
</div></div> and you can tweak from here to refine this if needed</p>

<p>Third, and I got caught on this myself <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>, double check you are using a 2.1 version of controller that actually supports regexing feedback from shell commands. Some of the earlier version will execute the commands, but cant perform the regexing.. OpenRemote-Controller-2.1.0_FM_SNAPSHOT-2013-07-18 works for me..</p>

<p>Hope some of this helps a bit, let me know..</p></font>

<p>many thanks for the reply I have tested a simple batch file</p>

<p>echo No<br/>
:end<br/>
:exit</p>

<p>I can see this read in by Openremote</p>

<p>If I set the  variable var to No and try this batch file it dosen't work </p>

<p>echo %var%<br/>
:end<br/>
:exit</p>

<p>If I run it at the command prompt it returns No which is correct</p>

<p>Have you any ideas</p>

<p>Pierce</p>

I can't get this value to update a sensor state or be used in a rule.</p>

My problem is that I get a java IO exception saying cannot run program.<br/>
I have virtually copied your batch file and placed both files in the controller.bin directory.<br/>
If you have any other suggestions I would appreciate them.<br/>
If UDPlistener would work on the free version of OR that would even be better.<br/>
Thanks, and have merry christmas.<br/>
