				    <p>I don't have a Mac and I'd like to work on the iPhone app. I know it is possible to build iPhone apps on Linux but constructing the environment is a mess. Can someone point me to instructions for putting together a Linux based iPhone development environment that works? I have tried to do this several times and I've failed. My source of failure is usually caused by getting the SDKs for the different iPhone firmware mixed up together. Perfect solution would be a deb/rpm that would install everything (or use scripts to download/extract if redistribution is prohibited).</p>
