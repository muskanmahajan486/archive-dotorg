				    <p>I have started looking into making basic interface working with my Lutron installation.  In the documentation for the designer, for creating the Lutron command, it refers to the "Address" field as one of the required fields.  The description states this field is "address of the device on the Lutron bus".  I have a full Integration report printed out of my Lutron system and have the device ID for each device on the system.  I have also managed to use the direct Telnet from command line and use standard Lutron integration commands to click on a button of a keypad or raise/lower a shade successfully.</p>

<p>I am having a hard time to figure out what to enter in the Address field in the designer to designate a keypad device in my system.  I tried to enter the device ID (from Lutron integration report) and it fails with error.  In the controller I see an exception thrown indicating Address field is invalid.  I looked into the source code and found that the Address field format is actually quite complex using the following regex:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">\x5b?(\d{1,2})[.:/\\-](\d{1,2})[.:/\\-](\d{1,2})(?:[.:/\\-](\d{1,2}))?(?:[.:/\\-](\d{1,2}))?\x5d?</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Can someone who is familiar for Lutron kindly point me to the right direction by providing an example of what I should enter in the Address field?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Eric,</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer.  So where does device ID come into play?  I ended up brushing up on my regex skills and figured out the format!  <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>It seems that the dash works as well as : so something like [1-6-1] is a legal entry to the address field.</p>

<p>I also found the place in the code where the parser does address validation further in the LutronHomeWorksAddress class.  But could not make sense of it and come up with a combination of numbers that works for my system.  For example I have device ID of 34 but the validation accounts for last number to be between 1 and 32.  So I could not use device ID there for my keypad (i.e. [1-6-34]).  In your example what do you mean by unit?</p>

<p>When I go to my Lutron software I am able to generate a full "Integration Report" of the system.  This report starts by pages that has one device per page.  For example a keypad device report looks like this:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">

<p>I have been able to successfully use this integration ID and perform telnet commands to control the devices based on the "Lutron Integration Protocol" document from here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/040249.pdf">http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/040249.pdf</a></p>

<p>So since I couldn't get this working last night I was able to use telnet protocol in designer successfully.  However, I would like to be able to start controlling my Lutron system in the most efficient way which I am guessing is using the Lutron protocol in OR.</p>

<p>Some background...</p>

<p>My Current System:  About 60% of my house is automated using Lutron.  This includes lighting and shades which I paid for dearly!  I have recently started looking into Z-Wave DYI automation with a Vera controller and so far it has been a smooth experience.  With Z-Wave I am planning to automate the rest of the switches in the house so that I can control everything remotely.  I also have another hobby of maintaining a saltwater aquarium which I have just started planning an elaborated system to build in the next 6-10 months in my new house.  I would like to automate/monitor all the Saltwater aquarium devices as well.</p>

<p>Long Term Goal:  Given that I am not too fond of the Lutron or the VeraMobile apps, I would like to have a single iOS app that can control everything in my house and is designed to my specific needs and liking.  That is why I have ended up here.</p>

The current Lutron protocol in OR only works with HomeWorks P5 systems (the older one, before QS).</p>

<p>I'll take a closer look at the QS protocol and see how we can adapt the current HomeWorks implementation, either to add a new QS protocol, either to have a unified Lutron protocol to supports both.</p></font>

<p>I currently have a number of Lutron products (Maestro wireless, Caseta Wireless and Serena Wireless shades) in my home. I am now looking <br/>
at a way to integrate these with the rest of the Openremote system I am building. Currently on the Free version, but will be moving to the <br/>
Pro version in the near future.</p>

<p>Has there been any progress updating the current Homeworks integration to QS as discussed above?</p>

<p>Has any work been done on integrating either RadioRA2 or Caseta wireless (Lutron SmartBridge Pro)?</p>

<p>If there are any ideas as to how this can be done, it would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I am not a Java programmer, but I am prepared to help if some direction could be provided.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>John</p></font>
