				    <p>Hello to all...I am going to say right off the bat that I have no clue what I am doing with OpenRemote as of yet, I am still going through the documentation trying to figure it out.  However, I was wondering if there are sources where I can find a list of commands,sensors and switches for specific devices.  Can someone please direct me to the information or if you have the already, please send them to me?</p>

<p>The devices for which I need the lists are as follows:</p>

<p>Receiver - Onkyo TX-NR616<br/>
Television - Vizio M550NV<br/>
Cable Box - Comcast XFinity Cisco (I can get specifics on the model later if needed)<br/>
PC running Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with XBMC 12.2 Frodo</p>

<p>Will I need any additional hardware, such as a GlobalCache Itach device?</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>As I understand what you are trying to achieve is to adapt your Homecinema to control this with your smart phone or tablet through openremote.<br/>
If this is the case then you will need some hardware to concentrate the control from a central point.</p>

<p>What you need is:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>A tablet or smartphone (User Interface), to run OpenRemote Panels</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>A dedicated server (pc, laptop, RaspberryPI, NAS, etc. ..), "To run OpenRemote Controller".</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>An IR gateway (eg Itach), "To control your IR devices"</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>An RF gateway "optional" (Z-wave, Zeebee, EnOcean, 433mhz, etc...) "To control your RF devices"</li>
</ul>


<p>Look at the reference image contained in this website to have a clearer idea:<br/>

<p>I hope this answers your concerns!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, however, I am really trying to figure out how to configure commands within the OpenRemote Designer.  For instance, when I click on the Onkyo TX-NR616 Device that I created within the OpenRemote Designer and select New Command, I am not sure what to enter in the command field.  are there documents that list these commands for specific devices...perhaps from the manufacturer or some other source?</p>

<p>Edit:  I have found the commands for the TX-NR616, however, I have no idea how to read and/or translate them to enter into the OpenRemote Commands.  Does anyone have an idea how to do this?  Please see the attached for the commands.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The commands listed in those Excel files are the one the Onkyo receiver does understand on its serial port. This means what really needs to go "over the wire".</p>

<p>In OpenRemote, there is an abstraction layer in the sense that the commands you enter in the designer are sent to a protocol (the one you choose when you create a command in the Designer) and it is the protocol implementation that will understand that command and along with the other parameters entered in the designer do something appropriate with that information.</p>

<p>With the current "stable" version, I believe the only option in there to connect to the Onkyo is to use an IP to serial converter and to use the TCP/IP protocol. Most of the time, these devices just pass the information from the IP connection to the serial port, which means the commands found in the above Excel files can be used.<br/>
There might be some tweaking required for line ending and such and I believe there have been discussion in the forums on this at some point.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to use a serial port available on your controller hardware (directly or via USB adapter). There is some work in this <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Emails%2C+Text-to-Speech%2C+Serial+Port">thread</a> about the addition of a serial protocol.</p>

<p>Last solution would be, similar to what we have for Marantz, to have a native protocol implementation in Java, supporting the Onkyo protocol. I did start work on direct IP connection to Onkyo devices some time ago but had to stop and don't have the device to test anymore. I thought I saw somebody report he had that working in this forum but can't find it again. If somebody finds it (or if you're the person who did that), can you please point me to it, would be a really good addition.</p>

<p>Erik, have you got any Java programming skills ? If so, I can point you to my branch and you could pick up the code I started.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Eric,</p>

<p>I have worked in the IT industry for over 20 years, however, I work on the technical end of things and, unfortunately, do not have any coding skills.  I will continue to experiment with the existing commands found in the spreadsheets above to see if I can get it working via TCP/IP.  Given the fact that there is already an remote control app, that is designed by Onkyo, for the android devices, I do not see why this would not work.  I will report back my findings if successful.  I am sure that I will have more questions along the way.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your replies and insight.  Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
