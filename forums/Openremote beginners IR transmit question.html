				    <p>Hi All,</p>


<p>Some time ago I installed OR on a raspberry PI with wheezy soft float following the excellent howto on this forum</p>

<p>(congrats to the authors)</p>

<p>I control lights and other stuff by X-10 and UDP.</p>

<p>I'm now making my first steps to install MPC MPD audio player on the raspberry and control it by shellcommands</p>

<p>Meanwhile I'm thinking how to control my audio amplifier</p>

<p>I think the most simple way is IR infrared</p>

<p>Can anyone help me or point me how to start.</p>

<p>IR transmit hardware is no problem to build myself (i prefer DIY)</p>

<p>How can a record IR codes from the excisting remote ontrol and send it later via IR to my audio amplifier</p>

<p>I only need a few commands: ON/OFF volume up/down and source select</p>

<p>I may assume that sending IR true the GPIO on the raspberry is not yett implemented, but using a Serial port (via USB)<br/>
should not be a problem i guess</p>

<p>Any help and suggestions are more then welcome</p>

<p>cheers</p>

<p>If you want to use a USB "dongle", you can take a look at LIRC, which is also supported in OR.</p>

<p>Otherwise, when you say amplifier, is this an A/V receiver ? If so, you might want to see if control via RS232/IP is possible. What brand/model is this ?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>HI,</p>

<p>A few months ago I made a research about the same topic and come to the conclusion that it was easier to buy something ready and supported by software that I wanted to use.</p>

<p>My choice was the WF2IR (Itach WiFi to IR), this is very easy to install, you can place it anywhere (*of course near the equipment to control) because is wireless, has 3 Independent selectable IR outputs or sensor inputs and of course also has a integrated learning unit.</p>

<p>If you wish you can extend the number of units to be controlled with a cable with multiple emitters or with an IR extender.</p>

<p>*I'm thinking that it would be more practical a unit that could send the signal in same way as the normal remote control without wires, in this way the device could be installed on the ceiling or wall and control all devices in a room without wires.</p>

<p>I've been looking for some units like the (Remotec XTX-120 BC), the problem with this device is that according to the manufacturer only works for air conditioning units. Remotec also has another unit to control AV devices but also works with wires</p>

<p>GlobalCaché has a blaster you can use with GC100 and iTach devices (GC-BL2 IIRC). This would achieve what you're after.<br/>
Just be slightly careful with sunlight and fluorescent light that can make IR transmissions unreliable.</p>

<p>That's one reason (other being hiding equipment in closet) why custom install often uses small flashers glued to the equipment.</p></font>
