				    <p>Been a long time since I hung about here, mightily impressed with how it's evolved over the last few years! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
I'm about to resume a HEPC/PVR build, I can't recall all the specifics OTTOMH, but it's basically a Core i5-530<img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/help_16.gif" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> &amp; Gigabyte ATX MB (H57?) from a few yrs ago.<br/>
At the time all components were chosen* for their "best in class" perf/efficiency &amp;/or flexibility/utility, for the large range of things I'd planned to do/integrate.<br/>
Alas all that hw's been sitting idle in it's packaging, &amp; only now am I finally about to use it all, but, better late than never I guess!</p>

<p>Just wondering if it's possible to use the <b>entire</b> OpenRemote suite in that build... <br/>
Do I lose any sw functionality by not forking-out some $ for the commercial version, or does that just simply afford me support services?<br/>
Is there any disadvantage in not using the recommended controller hw? (N.B. I live <b>primarily</b> in Australia)<br/>
I'd be adding only supported protocol bridging devices to my HEPC via USB/whatever, &amp; then the panels/end-devices on a ad-hoc basis over time.<br/>
Some recommendations on; protocol bridging devices, panel(s), &amp; end-devices** to start with, would be really appreciated too.<br/>
Any recommended Linux distro, or is whatever I settle on for my HEPC/PVR build fine? </p>


<p>Thanks for your time.<br/>

<p>There are some slight differences &#8211; for example with Z-Wave where we cannot release the implementation to Open Source. The releases are not synced either so some features may appear first on Professional version or vice versa, depending on availability of anyone to do the release (at least until we can get someone dedicated for release management). Some import functionality may also only be available on professional versions where repeated tasks over multiple accounts would otherwise get tedious.</p>

<p>By and large we attempt to make it clear on the wiki documentation whether some features are not included in the DIY version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there a commercial version targeted for DIY'ers? (who may or may not dip their toe into the Pro Installer scene longer-term)</p></blockquote>

<p>There's no separate product per se, but nothing in the professional version makes it unsuitable for DIY users. The free version may require some extra work to be done (in a DIY sense) where as the pro may have added convenience, or if you get the hardware, pre-installed controller and easier set up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In that case, what's the recommended controller hw to go for?</p></blockquote>

<p>Most PC's running Linux, Windows or Mac will do as long as there's sufficient memory (would recommend 512MB although minimum is lower) and a CPU that's at Intel Atom level (the low-end) or above. <a href="http://pcengines.ch/alix.htm">ALIX hardware</a> has been pretty well tested and works, and <a href="http://www.compactpc.com.tw/ebox-3300.htm">DMP ebox</a> is obviously what we test as well which you can go and purchase by yourself too.</p>

<p>There are other hardware platforms that you see people use, and they get mentioned here on the forums regularly.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Some recommendations on; protocol bridging devices, panel(s), &amp; end-devices to start with, would be really appreciated too.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can't recommend anything without knowing what you want to achieve, what your budget is, what's the availability of devices in your region, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I go for a commercial version, can I run it on a distro of my choice or is there a preferred distro/env?</p></blockquote>

<p>The regular Fedora, Ubuntu distros are ok, as are some specialized distributions such as Voyage. Basically anything either from the fedora or debian line should be ok. The key requirement is a modern Java VM (OpenJDK for example) on that distribution. Java is usually available on most x86 architectures, if you go to ARM then the choices are fewer.</p>

<p>It's pretty darn cool, you guys should get your sw on something like that!<br/>
I'm usually a <b>"pick your parts individually so you can get the best from each area"</b> kind of guy. <br/>
But I like where that device is going, especially for the average user.</p></font>

<p>Okay I hope it's thorough as-to-what exactly is missing, &amp; what it has that commercial doesn't at any given time?</p>

<blockquote><p>There's no separate product per se, but nothing in the professional version makes it unsuitable for DIY users.

<p>Okay thanks, I guess I'll look at pricing, but maybe without your hw as I'd prefer to use stuff I already own, so long as that doesn't make things way more difficult.</p>

<blockquote><p>ALIX hardware has been pretty well tested and works</p></blockquote>

<p>I actually bought a PC_Engines many moons ago &amp; never used it much, IIRC it was a WRAP:
<a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/wrap.htm">http://www.pcengines.ch/wrap.htm</a> <br/>
But I guess this would be too anaemic for a complex HA set-up, right?</p>

<blockquote><p>and DMP ebox is obviously what we test as well which you can go and purchase by yourself too.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'll probably give this a miss, unless one of your hw suggestions is highly recommended over using my current hw + commercial version of OR?<br/>
It looks anaemic/boring (albeit less than the Alix series) compared to my 2yo+ MB/Chipset, which could also be tasked with HA-related duties:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex86">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex86</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I can't recommend anything without knowing what you want to achieve, what your budget is, what's the availability of devices in your region, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just the typical range of things that most HA enthusiasts want to achieve, budget is no concern at this point, I can start high &amp; shave costs down from there.<br/>
Same for availability, so long as I have a wide range of things suggested, I should be able to find a few who supply my region (mostly Australia).</p>

<p>Excellent, noted, thanks for that!</p>

What are your thoughts on devices like the one referenced in my prior post?</p>

<p>It looks slightly on the low side on CPU and RAM.</p>

<p>Which one, the Almond?</p>

<p>It looks like a very interesting product. Have not dug up the hardware spec details. As part of our OEM strategy we do search for vendors who are interested in automation and prefer to reuse an Open Source codebase instead of reinventing that particular wheel. I think our sales may have pre-ordered Almond for a review.</p>

Not now necessarily, take your time, hopefully within 1-wk though if possible.</p>

<blockquote><p>Okay I hope it's thorough as-to-what exactly is missing, &amp; what it has that commercial doesn't at any given time?</p></blockquote>

<p>(2)</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay thanks, I guess I'll look at pricing, but maybe without your hw as I'd prefer to use stuff I already own, so long as that doesn't make things way more difficult.</p></blockquote>

<p>(3)</p>
<blockquote><p>I'll probably give this a miss, unless one of your hw suggestions is highly recommended over using my current hw + commercial version of OR?<br/>
It looks anaemic/boring (albeit less than the Alix series) compared to my 2yo+ MB/Chipset, which could also be tasked with HA-related duties:

<p>(4)</p>
<blockquote><p>Just the typical range of things that most HA enthusiasts want to achieve, budget is no concern at this point, I can start high &amp; shave costs down from there.<br/>
Same for availability, so long as I have a wide range of things suggested, I should be able to find a few who supply my region (mostly Australia).</p></blockquote>

<p>For point 4, I'll obviously buy from resellers/retailers/OEM's closely affiliated with (&amp; recommended by) this project.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Jeff,</p>

<p>I've started a year ago with OR controller on my Synology NAS with Intel processor and 3G RAM, quite happy with it as I've purchased it for different reason and got Openremote for free. My NAS is <a href="http://www.synology.nl/products/spec.php?product_name=DS1512%2B&amp;lang=us">http://www.synology.nl/products/spec.php?product_name=DS1512%2B&amp;lang=us</a><br/>
The only problem is when you try to use it's USB ports for something different than attaching external storage then you need to search for drivers as they have removed even standard linux drivers. Hoever, syno community is large so you should be OK here. People reported success with Z-wave and other protocols running from synology.</p>

<p>Other option would be to purchase the eBox with professional designer from openremote.com. Going this way has advantage that you start with top end solution and don't bump against problems which are caused solely by tailoring the pro version to free one (like Z-wave limited support, designer add-ons, etc.) For single project the price add on is fair and you can decide later if you would like to deploy your design if you can go with a free version or not.</p>

<p>Just my 2ct.</p></font>

<p>That doesn't fully address every final point above, but, thanks for adding your 2-cents...</p>

<p>I was planning to design/build my own NAS/VMM/bare-metal_hypervisor/kitchen_sink, but, the Synology &amp; QNAP solutions look sophisticated nowadays. <br/>
Plus, it's taken me "years" to find the time to do that, &amp; still I'm barely 1 step closer, so I'm very tempted to just buy a ready-made solution.<br/>
It just so happens that I was looking at the Synology &amp; QNAP sites right now, what made you go for Synology over QNAP?</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p></font>

At the time I was using Serviio DLNA server as the best of all and free too. It is still my choice when it comes to performance although I like Plex for its user interface. Anyway, Serviio DLNA server had an app for Synology so I've checked also if it has other stuff I need (Sabnzb, couch potato, sick beard, etc). It all was there, even more - like OR (I think at this time QNAP had neither of these). Also I could purchase in Netherlands the NAS precofigured with some tools which I wanted giving me a jump start to use my new hardware within minutes after delivery, Plug &amp; Play <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>. The same guy who came with the DLNA server has also put Openremote in the app shop. If I've bought QNAP at this point I would probably not come in contact with open remote till now.</p></font>

<p>Pushing? I'd hardly call it that when it's been about 4 bumps in 6-months+. </p>

<blockquote><p>Do remember this is all free open source community material. <br/>
People here reply to you in their free time, as they also spend a lot of their free time on developing.</p></blockquote> 

<p>You think I'm not aware of that....</p>

<blockquote><p>And please refrain from making religious references.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a expression/colloquialism, it wasn't meant in a religious context. <br/>
If it's seen as rude where you're from I can't help that...</p>

<p>Perhaps you need to get off your moral high horse &amp; mind your own business. <br/>
Esp. if you've nothing add but a necro-post laden with the tone of "the local law".</p></font>

<p>Well, I wasn't aware that was public information... <br/>
If it isn't but you've decided to publicly air it, that's also not a appropriate "style".</p>

For the full context, all that should be needed is a 5-min review of what was originally typed.<br/>

In the meantime, perhaps you might try to answer what's already there, you may find it's actually not as "unclear" as you assume.<br/>
I provided a direct link to the most relevant content/post....</p>
