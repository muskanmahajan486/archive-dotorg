				    <p>Hi</p>

<p>Marcus told me yesterday to share my problems here, so the community can participate...</p>

<p>Yesterday I hat to unzip the controller 2x because the webapps/controller directory turned into a 0 byte file instead.<br/>
On the editor side I could not add any icon to a newly created button/switch. Loading time is looooong and selection windows (i.e. commands) are not filled with items. trying to logout leads to a list of error windows on the right side of the browser. New login brings me back to a intermediate state of the panel I worked on latest. Sometimes I have the blue button/switch object, sometimes I have it connected to a command, sometimes not. Sometimes I have an icon on it, most times its the standard blue. Trying to save leads in an (i guess) infinite loop of doing nothing.<br/>
I've tried all day long but could not add anything that works.</p>

<p>Today I tried to continue, but same thing (except the controller problem. today nothing here).</p>

<p>What I recognized concerning Controller/Boss 2.0 (Browser): something is sending continuously data to the world. I could not figure out which one, but watching my monowall shows a constant datastream to where ever. That makes work for me even harder, because I have a very slow connection. Closing the Boss 2.0 Tab in browser (Chrome) and shutting down the controller ends this data sending...</p>

<p>ok, so far I got stucked doing anything on my KNX project and it looks for me like the dead end. I hope someone can help me out. I really like OpenRemote and yould love to use it here at home and even mor, to use it for customers...</p>

<p>don't hassle to contact me. If I can do anything to bring OR forward I will!<br/>

Can you verify which part of OR creates the network traffic? If you only open the designer or only run the controller, maybe we can limit to one of those 2.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>...ok - here we go with some details</p>

<p>starting Controller and watching the Controller's website on localhost causes no data transfer.<br/>
Starting BOSS 2.0 and doing nothing (!!) rises data transfer up to (my bad internet connection) about 80Kbps. I guess it comes from the error messages (getting visible by logging out).<br/>
After pressing "Logout" it takes a moment, the error messages appear on the right side and the data transmission stops.<br/>
First I thought it would be a background thread loading the data needed for the designer, but I waited a couple of minutes and it didn't change...</p>

<p>Hope that helps a little...<br/>

<p>It was a bit sluggish but not unusually so.</p>

<p>You said you had a slow connection, is there anywhere you can try with a faster connection to see if that makes a difference? The constant stream may be the autosave from client to server, I've not looked at it if it's smart enough to send a diff instead - assuming the autosave is the cause, then that might be it.</p>

<p>If you have any clear steps I can try in the designer where you see performance issues, let me know and I'll see if I can reproduce, or if it is caused by resource differences such as bandwidth.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Juha</p>

<p>you could try the following (which does not work for me)<br/>
log in<br/>
Go to panels<br/>
Select panel "Büro"<br/>
Add a button (maybe there are already one or two, so can use them)<br/>
Add a command to the button (the last one "Büro rollo auf")<br/>
Add an icon to the button<br/>
Save project</p>

<p>The latest point where the designer gives up is saving. Mostly before by adding the command<br/>
Logging off then shows the error windows on the right. </p>

<p>Does this work for you?</p>

<p>I will try to get access anywhere else with a faster connection. </p>

<p>Till soon...</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I tried with Chrome this time and it was quite a bit slower. I think it may be due to caching since I normally user FF, so it probably had many things already cached locally.</p>

<p>However, the steps you outlined did work (once the very long load time is done).</p>

<p>I did notice the errors on log out, so will see if I can spot them on the logs, and will check the server to see if anything pops out there that could help.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>HI!</p>

<p>I just had the possibility to try Boss 2.0 on a system with a good internet connection.<br/>
The startup was slow, but working with the designer went ok.</p>

<p>Only thing (and that was the killer on continuing the work) I only saw the panels on the one tree and the command on the other. No sensors, no switches. only commands. This was the moment I got a little temperature, but opening the designer on my computer showed up everything.</p>

<p>I did not try to look at any sources (they are available, right?) but, Juha, is there a possibility to set up the server in a way that it saves data locally, not via internet (maybe install a database here on my server (WIN) or anything else.<br/>
Or what about a flexible autosave interval? SO I could have a try to continue work and when finished I hit save myself...</p>

<p>Maybe in a month or so we get a faster connection here, but by now I do not know how to continue...</p>

<p>thanks for your help!<br/>

<p>I am back, again. Yesterday I got the lightning fast internet connection - YES!<br/>
First thing I tried was the editor. By now it works fine. Enough speed means work is ok.<br/>
Some other things show up now (i.e. already reported German Umlaute "ÄÖÜäöüß" are not displayed.<br/>
Things I need to know/report come in a separate thread <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>thanks for the work. One thing: Is it possible to start a productive environment for a customer? Do I get support if things are stopping the show?</p>
