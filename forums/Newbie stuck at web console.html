				    <p>Hello, <br/>
I like the layout and potential power of OpenRemote but I am stuck at getting panel connection from anywhere on my network except on the server itself. When I launch <a href="http://localhost:8080/webconsole">http://localhost:8080/webconsole</a> on the server my control panel comes up with it's controls and background image and all appears to work correctly. When I try to connect from any other location on my local network a search locates the controller but can't launch the control panel. I tried editing the control parameters but nothing makes any difference. Note that the controller address detected by the remote host comes back as <a href="http://192.168.1.105:8080/controller">http://192.168.1.105:8080/controller</a>. (The IP address is the server). I opened port 8080 in windows firewall and even turned the firewall off to test it but still no connection.<br/>
Boot log shows only one potential problem ..... "No definitions found in "C:\OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.2\webapps\controller\rules"<br/>
but it then goes on to initialise event processor : Drools Rule Engine and then reports setup complete.<br/>
I would really like to get the webpages running from any location so any help or suggestions would be very much appreciated.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Clive Alcock</p>
