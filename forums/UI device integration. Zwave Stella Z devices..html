<p>I have created my Z-Wave network with a raspberry pi and a Aeons Z2 usb stick connecting two tkb switches (also relays) to Stella Z valves throughout a house. All these devices and switches have now successfully appeared in my openremote designer pro web application.</p>

<p>I have produced my navigation menus on an android device and am now looking at how to wire this up (figuratively speaking) to the android interface so that information is displayed and changes can be made to each valve.</p>

<p>These Stella Z devices have information such as current temperature, battery status , mode type such as "frost protection", "energy saving", "comfort". These are reported and some are set.</p>

<p>Is there a guide for connecting up these to a UI? I've seen the "creating navigation for openremote" video</p>


<p>Is there a UI widget template for the stella Z does anyone know?</p>
