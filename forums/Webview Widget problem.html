				    <p>Hi, </p>

<p>I am having a problem with Nexus 5 Android and WebView element. As soon as I add a webview element the OR App goes into a force stop mode I have tried adding the URL both as domain name and IP address, but doesn't make any difference. As soon as I remove the WebView element from the designer, and re-sync, it works again. Can you tell me what I am doing wrong.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Hassan,</p>

<p>I had the same problem, with the same device, this week-end, and I just found the answer 1h ago in an old message from an old topic.<br/>
Anyway, if you have the version 2.0.0 Beta2 of the android app, you need to install an other version :  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openremote/files/For%20Developers/OpenRemote-2.0-Android_SNAPSHOT_20111012.apk/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/openremote/files/For%20Developers/OpenRemote-2.0-Android_SNAPSHOT_20111012.apk/download</a></p>

<p>This is the version 2.0.0 Beta3. There is a version 2.1.0 (you can find the link in this forum), but I don't know why, the webview doesn't work fine with it for me... Be careful ! Your widgets will be very small in your device. When you create a new panel, you need to create a CUSTOM panel, with the size of your screen (I think it's 1080*1920 for the nexus 5). And after this, that should work fine.</p>

<p>I hope I helped you !</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Antoine,</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help. It solved the problem and with the Beta3 version the web element works<br/>
I will test the 2.1.0 tomorrow and get back to you as to whether it works on my device or not.<br/>
I am very new to OR so sometimes things aren't as I expect them be.<br/>
For the Webview, I set the URL to go to Google.<br/>
I thought that I had to hit the webview element tab (on the mobile phone) in order for the browser to be launched and the browser would then display the Google web page.<br/>
What in fact happened, was that the Google page was visible in the Webview element immediately (as soon as OR was launched).<br/>
I wanted to use this Webview functionality to view cameras.<br/>
However, if the camera is going to be continuously accessed, this defeats the purpose, as the camera will start streaming as soon as the OR App is run (whether I want to view the camera or not).<br/>
The reason I didn't check on 2.1.0 was to see if what I am seeing on 2.0.0 Beta3 is in fact correct or not, and how the camera issue is to be treated (if what I am seeing is correct).<br/>
I would be most grateful if you would advise on this.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br/>
Hassan</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Hassan,</p>

<p>What you see is correct. The purpose of the webview is to give immediately a view of a web page.<br/>
I don't understand why it's wrong for you to access continuously the camera, but whatever you do with your app, you can put the webview in another screen, so you won't see the camera everytime you start the app but just when you want. I'm probably as new as you, so I have ideas, but I'm not an expert...</p>

<p>I think what you are saying is the only way to do this, so I will go ahead with this.<br/>
I am afraid my knowledge fell short for testing the 2.1.0 Android console.<br/>
I went to <a href="https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/workspace/richturner/tag/Android_Console_2_1_0_Beta">https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/workspace/richturner/tag/Android_Console_2_1_0_Beta</a><br/>
which was the link in the forum.<br/>
Didn't know which file I had to download, and got out of there as quickly as I could.<br/>
Once again thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br/>
