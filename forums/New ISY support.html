				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I've just checked in some controller code which uses the Soap interface to the ISY to watch for real-time status changes.  This was based on how the Lutron work, I actually use Telnet for the connection as I couldn't get the Soap stuff working using httpclient libs.</p>

<p>You can find the work here:
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/openremote/code/HEAD/tree/workspace/craigham/Controller_2_1_0_ISY/">https://sourceforge.net/p/openremote/code/HEAD/tree/workspace/craigham/Controller_2_1_0_ISY/</a></p>

<p>Now if the isy command builder is asked to build a 'status' command, it builds one which ties into the soap subscription.  I have also added a second type of listening command for the get power....it should be 'get-power' for the command.  This is very similar to how Dan did the omnilink commands for the HAI lights.  </p>

<p>I have also checked in some code for the designer which will interrogate your ISY and create the various devices.  It works for lights with and without dimmers, motion sensors, relays, water leak detectors.  I don't have a thermostat so I wasn't able to add that code.</p>

<p>Here is the designer work:
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/openremote/code/HEAD/tree/workspace/craigham/Designer_2_14_0_SNAPSHOT-2013-05-11-ISY/">https://sourceforge.net/p/openremote/code/HEAD/tree/workspace/craigham/Designer_2_14_0_SNAPSHOT-2013-05-11-ISY/</a></p>

<p>Just click on the New button within the Devices section and select Import ISY devices.  You'll have to refresh the dialog after you have imported the devices as I copied how Dan did it with Omnilink, and inherited that behaviour.  </p>

<p>These are still pretty alpha, have to add error handling, and bunch of other stuff, but if anyone can try it out and give me ideas that would be great.</p>

<p>regards,<br/>

I am a former full time developer (long time ago, but I wrote code professionally for 10+ years) and have been a technology lawyer for the last 16 years. I have 70 or so Insteon devices in my house, and am communicating with them via an ISY-99. Is there any way to read the status of the Insteon switch with the current released code, or do we need your additional features to do that? If the latter, how do I deploy your additional features? Thanks!</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi David,</p>

<p>I found the existing insteon code problematic in that it would set up a polling thread which made an http call to check status for each insteon device.  My isy controller would start blocking.  I may have 50-70 devices.</p>

<p>The code I contributed instead sets up 1 connection to the isy controller, and simply subscribes for status updates, and then invokes the necessary commands within Open Remote.</p>

<p>Patching in development code isn't the easiest thing in the world to do, especially if you are not familiar with java, ant, and subversion.  Thus, I would recommend you get a copy of the released code and see if you can get it working for what you are trying to accomplish.  If you run into the same behaviour I did, then I would suggest you checkout my code, and learn how to build it.  It's not that difficult, but you will need java and I believe ant. </p>

<p>The other challenge is that modelling something seemingly as simple as a light switch actually requires quite a few commands.  So the manual work in setting up your system for your 70 insteon would be onerous.  This leads you to really wanting the designer code changes I made as well.  This allows you to just point open remote to the ISY controller, and it will then create all the commands, sensors, switches, etc.  Your 70 devices could easily end up requiring 500 or more commands.</p>

<p>This may sound discouraging, and I guess it really should be.  I previously had worked for over 10 years doing enterprise java, which included all the technologies used within open remote.  It was/is challenging to set up a complete developer environment.</p>

<p>I have found the code I contributed does work really well for keeping track of status of the insteon devices.  If you are really motivated to take this on as a hobby, I'd say go for it.  However, if you're thinking you may spend a few hours on it and have some substantial home automation set up, this won't be for you.</p>

<p>The fact is that you are the first person who has even asked me about this code.  Take that as indicative of the activity around insteon and open remote.  I have noticed some activity around insteon using the released code, but from my perspective it is all rather usless as it is, I don't see how you could do meaningful automation.</p>

<p>If you are interested in taking this on, I'd be happy to provide assistance.  </p>

<p>Also, I haven't checked the released code in close to a year, they may have put out new releases which make some of my previous findings obsolete.  However, I haven't found there is much velocity with Open Remote in terms of new features, etc.  </p>

<p>cheers,<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Craig, thanks very much for the thoughtful response. I've been working with OpenRemote released code for a few years, and I'm fairly confident that what I want to do can't easily be done. I have therefore downloaded VisualSVN, ANT, and Java, and, after a couple of hours, I have actually gotten your code to compile for the controller. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> I'm trying to compile the designer, however, and it looks like there is a dependency on a file that is not downloaded or a directory that does not exist - there error that I'm getting is "I:\users\Daniel\workspace\openremote\gwt-2.4.0 does not exist". Is this something I should be able to find in someone else's workspace, or is this something that you have? Thanks!</p></font>

<p>Nice progress.</p>

<p>This next part getting designer up was really challenging for me.</p>

<p>I would make sure you get gwt 2.4...I was getting runtime issues when I tried to compile the composer using 2.5.x gwt.</p>

<p>Also, I'm not sure about this, but I believe you will have to download your own beehive web app to run designer.  You will also want to make sure you have mysql installed, if i remember correctly there are some sql scripts in either the composer source tree, or beehive.  Run those....mysql -u root -p &lt;password&gt; &lt; sql_script.sql (Could be greater than sign, rusty on linux command line).  (that assumes linux/mac too)</p>

<p>You also probably want to install tomcat on your computer and then deploy composer, and beehive there (using server.xml file - see app deployment to point to .war files created by ant builds.  For controller, i think i just put a symbolic link within webapps directory of your tomcat to point back to controller directory which is producted from the controller ant build.  Lots of steps, read carefully and good luck.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hey, Craig. I hope that all is well with you. Significant progress since my last note. I have done all of the following:<br/>
1.) I have built and deployed an Ubuntu server<br/>
2.) I downloaded the codebase from the branch referenced above and have gotten it to compile<br/>
3.) I deployed the code and created a test slider for one of the Insteon lights. And, it works, sort of.</p>

<p>But, there is a fair amount of latency and there are copious errors in the log files. There appear to be connection errors as described at <a href="http://openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20450712">http://openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20450712</a>. I tried adding "close" commands as documented at the above webpage, but then I started getting other errors regarding sockets being closed. Any suggestions? As noted above, I have quite a few Insteon devices, and it sounds like maybe I'm hitting the ISY too hard or too frequently. Something like the code at R8128? Thanks! BTW, I'm copying some of the error text below from the dev log:</p>

<p>Looking at the stack trace you are still using the 'stock' polling code for the insteon stuff.</p>

<p>Can you confirm that you have the following source file in your project?</p>

<p> InsteonDeviceAddress.java</p>


<p>Then, I would go into the controller folder within the webapps folder and check to make sure there is also a .class file with that same class name, just to make sure you are running the code you expect.</p>

<p>Do you have the ability to run the controller in debug mode?  That is very handy to solve issues as well.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks, Craig! I'll review this afternoon and see what is there. I used SVN to pull the code, but I may have done something incorrectly. Also, I was able to compile designer and run it. When I went to import my Insteon devices, it appeared to hang (and the dialog box never closed). But, when I restarted designer, it had imported all of my Insteon devices. I'll keep playing with it. A few quick questions:</p>

<p>1.) Do you know of any way to export my config from the online designer so that I can play import it into the local copy of designer, with your adds?</p>

<p>2.) I'm not sure that I mentioned it, but I'm an attorney. In fact, I'm the type of attorney that does (almost exclusively) software licensing, and I have done so for the last 16 years. If you would like to get your code into the codebase, I can at least try to figure out the GPL licensing issue that Juha mentioned. I can't guarantee that there's a solution, but there might be, and I would do that for free, in consideration of your helping me with my stupid problems <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>3.) Also, do you like coffee? If so, I would like to send you a Starbucks card or something - REALLY appreciate the help. It's been (much) more than a decade since I was a full-time developer. It's fun, though, and some concepts are coming back relatively quickly.</p>

<p>4.) Re running the controller in Debug mode, I'll see if I can figure that one out next! Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>David,</p>

<p>I'll respond to each question below</p>

<p>1) I don't.  I'd be surprised if there was a tool out there.  What I have found is that my adds have been so crucial for my particular setup, that I can't see myself using the online designer again unless my code migrates into the main codebase.  I'd suggest getting this insteon stuff working locally, and when you are happy with that, manually bring your other devices/setup over.  Otherwise you could probably write a script which could go through the controller.xml file which is downloaded from the online designer and create sql for it...that would be a significant undertaking.</p>

<p>2)  In the year or so since I announced this code, I have had very little interest by others.  I really can't see anyone using the existing insteon code in their setup, the http polling method was basically useless for me.  I haven't looked into the legal reasons my code hasn't been migrated in.  I've just assumed it was more due to lack of interest combined with the limited resources of the maintainers of the main code base to test and apply patches to add it.  You could maybe follow up with Juha if you spending time on the licensing stuff would provide meaningful value to the project.</p>

<p>3) Yes, coffee is good, but no need for anything like that.  I have been helped many times in the past by people myself.  For me having my contributions used by others is reward enough, and I have no doubt your interest will in turn improve the contribution itself, which helps me out.  Thanks for the offer though.</p>

<p>4) Debug mode is really helpful.  You'll want to look at the catalina.sh file which is the start script for the tomcat instance.</p>

<p>I've added a line like this:</p>

<p>CATALINA_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y</p>

<p>And then within Eclipse I just start a remote debugging session pointing to address 8000</p>

<p>Keep firing me questions, glad to help.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks, Craig! OK - I verified that I have InsteonDeviceAddress.java. I also tried to rename the file just to see if the code still compiled, and when I renamed it, and the compile failed on the references in that file. I also verified that there is a class file named InsteonDeviceAddress.class in the isy99 folder (in the folder \\ubuntu-dkd\tomcat\controller\WEB-INF\classes\org\openremote\controller\protocol\isy99 to be precise).<br/>
So, I'm stumped a bit as to why the old version of the code is running. A few questions:</p>

<p>1.) There are six source java files in the protocol\isy99 directory, but they compiled into eight class files - there is one class file for each of the java files but there are also two extra files - one named Isy99Command$1.class and one named IsyStatusListenCommand$StatusType.class. Is that meaningful?</p>

<p>2.) With regard to running in debug mode, I'm working on that, but I think my configuration may make it difficult or marginally different. My Ubuntu server is running the server code only. Will the Eclipse code run on Ubuntu server or do I need to do something different (e.g., load Ubuntu desktop on top of my server code). Alternatively, I tried loading Eclipse IDE on my Windows machine (which is on the same network and which I'm using to access the Ubuntu server via Putty and OpenSSH). I was able to load Eclipse on the Windows box, but I'm not (yet) able to debug the session running on the Ubuntu server. Any suggestion re what is the best way to access and debug? I can't easily work directly on the Ubuntu box, as it is located remotely (in another room, which is fairly small). I'm not opposed to loading Ubuntu desktop on top of the server code if (a) that would help, and (b) that would allow me to run Eclipse on the Ubuntu box directly, but if I'm doing that, is there a good protocol by which I can still access the Ubuntu desktop instance remotely (e.g., something analogous to OpenSSH, which I'm assuming (possibly incorrectly) will not allow me to access the GUI remotely.</p>

<p>3.) Please let me know if you would like me to email any of the error logs and, if so, to where.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>1)  That is expected with those extra class files.  Those are inner classes which are defined in the .java file.  The compiler creates those files.</p>

<p>2)  You would want to run eclipse on your desktop, this does not have to be the same machine as what is running the open remote controller/designer.  Within run remote debug session in eclipse, you can enter the ip address of the machine you want to debug.  For local tomcat instances you would go with 127.0.0.1, with remote specify the ip of the machine running tomcat in debug mode.  I think once you get going you really will want to be able to run open remote on the machine you would be doing your developing.  This makes for quicker build/test cycles as you don't have to be worrying about moving new code over to the server each time.  It would also let you have a place where you can continue running 'production' openremote for your house, and then test new things on your dev box.  No need to worry about this until you get it all going though.</p>

<p>3) Could you look at the /webapps/controller/controller.xml file which is used by the controller code, and let me know if you see a command similar to this:  ignore name of course</p>

<p>&lt;code&gt;<br/>
&lt;command id="120" protocol="isy99"&gt;<br/>
      &lt;property name="address" value="20 92 3D 1" /&gt;<br/>
      &lt;property name="command" value="status" /&gt;<br/>
      &lt;property name="name" value="great.room.stairs.down cmd level" /&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/command<br/>
&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>I'm curious if you controller.xml file is matching up with my contribution code.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks again - I really am going to need to do something for you at some point (if you ever need any software licensing advice, please let me know <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/>). In any case:</p>

<p>1.) My controller.xml file does include the following command (among many others):</p>

<p>    &lt;command id="120" protocol="isy99"&gt;<br/>
      &lt;property name="address" value="2A 24 7B 1" /&gt;<br/>
      &lt;property name="command" value="DFOF" /&gt;<br/>
      &lt;property name="name" value="Outside Front Entry cmd-off" /&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/command&gt;</p>

<p>2.) I've made some progress on the remote debugging, but not there yet. On my Windows box, I load Eclipse, go to "run", "debug configuration" and select Remote Java Application. On the connection properties, I have included 192.168.0.172, port 8000. The response that I get is the following: Failed to connect to remove VM. Connection refused. I think this means that I've got the Catalina config messed up somehow. I've included all of the following in /etc/environment on the Ubuntu server:</p>

<p>PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games" <br/>
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64<br/>
export CATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat7<br/>
export CATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/tomcat7<br/>
export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y"<br/>
export JDPA_ADDRESS=8000<br/>
export JDPA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket</p>

<p>BTW, I'm not sure that it matters, but I'm running two openremote controllers on the home network. One (with the old code) for live instance, changing TV channels, etc. One with the new code for testing. FWIW, I tried unloading the live controller but it didn't seem to make a difference.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>What you need to do is look for a file called controller.xml which is created whenever you hit save while in designer.  I think it shows up in my bin folder of tomcat, under a directory called null.  I never bothered fixing this to something more logical.</p>

<p>Do a file search for controller.xml, or openremote.zip which is another file which is created by designer when you hit save.</p>

<p>Then go to the controller web page, and select work offline, and point to the controller.xml file which you are creating.</p>

I do get the "save successful" message box, and the time stamp on the controller.xml in the designer modeler_tmp directory updates. But, the file is still the same, with no "status" entries. There are "cmd-off", "cmd-on", "cmd-fast on", "cmd-off", "get power", "get level", and "set level", but no "status". Can you email me a copy of a controller.xml file that is "good" so that I know what I'm looking for? BTW, I'm not seeing any controller.xml files under the tomcat7\work directory. If you are comfortable doing so, my email is ddaggett1@ptera.net. Thanks!</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Craig, thanks for the file. Some interesting developments:</p>

<p>1.) None of the "cmd level" suffix devices had "status" for the command. All were "get-level". <br/>
2.) I reset the database and recompiled designer and reimported the devices, and they were still all set to "get-level" and not "status". Thus, I'm wondering if there is an issue with either designer or the import command.<br/>
3.) I went into Beehive using MySQL and changed all of the "get level" commands to status and resaved and manually loaded the controller.xml file.<br/>
4.) At that point, I think it started calling your new code. But, now the commands are not working at all on the slider that I had created. That said, the error logging was completely different. I'm sending you the log by email. I'm wondering if it is a Java version error? I'm using java-6-openjdk-amd64.</p></font>

<p>I will take a look and make sure I have synced up the designer and controller checkins.  I possibly did some refactoring and one of the projects is out of sync.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you could manually set up a device within controller by double clicking the commands and making sure they match what you see within my controller.xml example.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks, Craig. I made some progress. Because I was manually editing the "status" command into Beehive, I apparently screwed up the SQL statement and put "status" into too many places. I re-did this, and it generally worked for the slider I had created. Still some quirkiness. In any case, the designer code is still generating "get-level" command as opposed to "status," so I should probably sit tight until you upload the newer designer code. THANKS SO MUCH!</p></font>

There is some weirdness with the slider bouncing around, but I'll take a look at that before wasting your time. One question - in designer, when I import Insteon devices, should it add all of the resources (commands, sensors, slider, and switch) for each Insteon device, or only for dimmers. I just noticed that it appears to be doing so only for dimmers. Not a huge issue, but is that intended behavior? Thanks!</p></font>

<p>For something like a simple relay a slider would not be added.  If there is a type of device that you think is missing something when modelled in designer let me know.</p>

<p>The modelling of insteon devices to open remote is done in the class CreateISYDevicesActionHandler in designer.  Feel free to check what is happening there and make any changes/suggestions.  I only have a subset of the different insteon devices so there will surely be some improvements needed.</p>

I have OpenRemote controlling both through HTML REST interface, and I had hoped that OR would be the master controller, but your discussion indicates to me that this is going to be way more complicated than I had anticipated. I will just reach out like Gregory to the powers that be to write something into OR to make it easier.  I code, but not hard-core like you guys!</p></font>

I'll probably hold back another couple of weeks in hopes that someone might respond about how / where this code is implemented in the public side. I know there's a "staging" Designer instance out there - maybe others? But if I end up doing it, I'll be sure to confirm how well the documentation goes in terms of implementing it on a Raspberry Pi. </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hey guys, I am still around.</p>

<p>I'm really not sure what it would entail to get my isy code committed to production.  I figured it would take enough interest from the community, and then maybe the open remote guys would reach out and get the ball rolling.</p>

<p>The changes to the controller are rather trivial to get rid of the polling.  My changes just use the telnet client to connect to port 80 on the isy, and maintain a long term event subscription.  </p>

<p>However, the designer changes are very helpful as there is an explosion of commands, switches,  sliders, etc when you want to hook in to even a moderate isy setup.  I haven't been watching the open remote project much lately, so I really don't know what's going on.  I presume this would be a much more difficult undertaking.  Does anyone know if Dan's omnilink device discovery was ever integrated into the designer production?  The isy device discovery is very, very similar.</p>

<p>I've been spending some time lately trying to figure out if openhab is a better solution for me.  That project is also in java, and has quite a few 'bindings', i.e. to Nest, etc.  When I last checked open remote that wasn't in yet either.</p>

<p>Let me know if you guys decide to try and get the controller and/or designer working so you can continue to develop what I started, I'd be glad to help out if i can.</p>

<p>cheers,<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks so much for replying, Craig. </p>

<p>I'll reach out if I go down that road. </p>

<p>I didn't realize you were just using telnet - not using the UDI API calls. </p>

<p>I completely agree on the advantages that a well built setup would make. The Russound automatically created the first six zones and populated them - what a HUGE advantage over the mess of building a half-dozen OR devices PER INSTEON DEVICE! to get everything to work. I am not looking forward to that and it's a big reason I've postponed while hoping this portion of OR would mature while I wait. </p>

<p>I appreciate the mention of that other project... I'll look into that as well. I'm not very far down the OR road yet and I'm eager to find a setup with this same architecture but more active development community versus active back-end / professional-implementer stuff. Nothing wrong with that, of course; but it makes it really difficult to move forward if Russound and KNX are the only mature elements in the package. </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi, it really is a shame that we haven't gotten enough support from the community to get this thoroughly tested and committed. This would be incredibly helpful to have in the main production code. I'm in the exact same boat as having an Open Remote controller running on my Synology NAS and using an ISY to control Insteon devices. I thought the sensor functionality was great until I added too many and ran into the exact same bottleneck issue which has now forced me to rethink and degrade my entire UI design to use simple buttons instead of intelligent switches. </p>

<p>From a functionality/price perspective, it is hard to beat the Insteon devices. I can only imagine their popularity will continue to grow as they introduced their new HomeKit enabled controller. </p>

<p>Craig, definitely appreciate all your work on this. I may too embark on compiling and hosting my own designer. Just trying to figure out whether the pros will outweigh the significant time investment. </p>

<p>I'm also going to check out OpenHab. I would hate to have to make the switch but unfortunately not having the status functionality is a real killer. </p></font>

<p>I haven't moved to my own Designer and have basically kept switching to a web interface for Insteon control. I'm doing the same thing with Squeezebox, XBMC/KODI, and OpenHome. Crappy; but it all works. But it /should/ all be do-able in Open Remote; but I'm not a programmer. </p>

<p>I feel like I'm biding time until either Open Remote or some other project or system gets up and going that supports Insteon, Russound, and Global Cache all in 2-way modes with Android clients - preferably with GUI interfaces versus packaged UI like OpenHAB. I was running MainLobby and had support for all those things in full 2-way; but the clients are all Windows. It seems like it's /time/ for something to get off the ground that does this stuff without me having to be a full-on code-writer. </p></font>
