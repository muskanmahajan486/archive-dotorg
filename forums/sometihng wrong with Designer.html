				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'll try to explain my trouble. I have done a lot of test with openremote on Raspberry Pi.<br/>
I had certainly done something wrong with the designer because nothing with date time protocol or shell command are not working always N/A.</p>

<p>To resolve it, I had deleted alls devices , all panels, make a new simple panel , sync lots of time , results still the same.<br/>
Except when I save a configuration i manually export (file) the new config. and weird the first exports worked properly and not the last ones</p>

<p>As I'm a patient person, I tried exactly the same operations with a new account on the same Rasp PI and now it's working!!!!!</p>

<p>My first question is simple why can't I delete completely a project (device,panel,rules..) and restart from scratch ?<br/>
2 nd , Is it possible to reset a account ? just to be sure ?</p>

<p>Waiting for yours comments.</p>

<p>I know now it's coming from &lt;OpenRemote&gt;/webapps/controller/rules/modeler_rules.drl is not really empty space and line break in it. but still in <br/>
all my new configuration and sync. I can over pass but not resolved it properly.</p>

<p>I wish i had an answer to your question but I am also new. Sorry!</p>

<p>What test have you done with openremote on Raspberry Pi. I also have installed the OpenRemote on the Raspberry pi. <br/>
I want to create the GUI for a 5 bedroom house, i have created something using this video; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_S4BbVnxyM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_S4BbVnxyM</a>.</p>

<p>Is any device that i need to be able to create a full functional GUI?</p>

<p>Sorry for giving you so many question while you needed an answer.</p>

<p>Your help will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Regards<br/>
Sara.</p></font>

<p>Great Video, very nice and helpfull.</p>

<p>By the way, I didn't find an issue to my problem because it's a bug from the designer.<br/>
If we had a rules and we want to clear it. It's still didn(t completely clear the file &lt;OpenRemote&gt;/webapps/controller/rules/modeler_rules.drl <br/>
We have to do it by hand.<br/>
Or another solution is to sign up to a new account and don't clear a rules.<br/>
Best regards.<br/>
Alain</p></font>
