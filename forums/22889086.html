				    <p>hi,</p>

<p>followed the sonos integration howto and it works like expected for play, pause, next, prev, etc...</p>

<p>But I need support for the state/sensor to output e.g. the artist's name to a label.</p>

<p>What I did:</p>

<p>a) verified that the <a href="http://localhost:5005/">http://localhost:5005/</a>"sonos player name"/state brings back the state structure like described and it works fine.</p>

<p>b) Created a command to get this state in OR designer, with the Http line from a) and a GET as http-method. Now I understand it is necessary to use a JSON path property to select the information for the label text.</p>

<p>As I am a rookie with node.js this means to me: Add "$.currentTrack.artist" (without ") into the JSON Path expression input, and hope that it gets filled with the artists name... <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>c) Then I created a sensor and assigned the state command from b) </p>

<p>d) Finally I added a label to my OR GUI and selected this sensor.</p>

<p>But the label only shows a "N/A", means it does not work like expected.<br/>
Hope that somebody can fill the gap and advise what must be changed to make this working.</p>

<p>thanks for the hint with the logfile and loglevel change.</p>

<p>Confirmed that the state answer was correct but I could test and check the JSON path statements. One can see very clear if there is an error or not.</p>

<p>I tried several JSON path entries but ended up with $.currentTrack.artist again.</p>

<p>But only when I add a polling interval value, e.g. 3s, it works....!</p>

One of the issues is that if you are listening to a radio stream it does pull back the relevant data from Station name or what's playing.   </p>

<p>This is what he has told me:</p>

<p><em>The What's playing part is different between radio and regular music streams, as you have noticed. I haven't really figured out what would be the best approach here, see this discussion:</em></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-discovery/issues/18">jishi/node-sonos-discovery</a></p>

<p><em>Is it possible to do something like this in openremote (psuedo code)?</em></p>

<p>currentlyPlaying = $.playerState.currentTrack.Title || $.playerState.currentTrack.Radiostation</p>

<p><em>Or have conditionals at all, like, "if radiostation, read property x, otherwise use property y"?</em></p>

<p>Is someone able to give me the answer to these questions so I can get back to him??  Thanks</p>
