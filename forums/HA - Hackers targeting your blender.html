<p>But to get serious, almost everything within home automation is done with the implicit assumption of a trusted LAN. Openremote is no exception. Devices like the Globalcache listens to a tcp-port to which anyone with access to the network can access. With a simple tool like netcat a "bad guy" can do a lot of "interesting things". Also DOS (denial-of-service) is very simple, no trivial, since many devices allow only one connection at a time. Autodiscovery etc also makes the life of an intruder easier.</p>

<p>The only exception I know of is Eventghost, that has some access control for its network connections.</p>

<p>What I want to say is this: is home automation with non trusted LAN a usecase to consider?</p>

<p>BTW, I am still against the usage of the word "hacker" as synonym for a computer criminal.</p></font>

<p>However it is still a valid point especially with translator hardware such as GC or IRTrans vis-a-vis security. Managing this with existing hardware yields some complicated setups and many of the existing hardware (and HA solutions in general) don't address the issue of security.</p>

<p>Beyond home automation to building automation this is definitely a real concern.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I agree, I think I would not expose my HA setting outside a DMZ - if not a separate LAN than the one connected to Internet.</p>

<p>But I also think the use case of connected home automation exists, and that vendors will start selling it. There's the efficiency promise that smart grids make, and that get attention from industry and governments. Take Whirlpool that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10386123-54.html">plan to stop manufacturing dumb appliances by 2015</a>. I'm sure others will follow. Imagine ISP or other actors selling cheaper electricity if you connect some appliances to their box, and let them remotely trigger your washing machine or water boiler when the price is low. Or take initiatives like <a href="http://www.flukso.net/">http://www.flukso.net/</a>. It's not HA, but already you leak a lot of information about you and your home (usage habits, holidays, etc.)</p>

<p>In an ideal world everyone would be aware of that kind of threat and take decision about their setup accordingly. But I join Juha when he says that it's already complex, even for actors of the field. </p></font>
