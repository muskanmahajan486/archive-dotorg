				    <p>Hi,<br/>
I use safari on a mac, but problems seems to be generated by the code, not browser.</p>

<p>1) Templates are saved, but doesen't appear in the template section, so I cannot delete or rename them.<br/>
When I create a screen from template, I find all the templates I created previously.<br/>
Speaking about private templates...</p>

<p>2) Sometimes some objects disappear from my iPhone panel. Rebuild from zero a Tabbar can take long time, with all items and properties.</p>


<p>PROPOSED SOLUTIONS:</p>

<p>1) Bug fixing. Sorry I'm not an expert and can't figure out.</p>

<p>2a) Currently tabbar are not saving in a template. Should be, so I can recreate a screen with the tabbar and propagate it to the group</p>

<p>2b) Copy and paste for items between screens can be developed. If something disappears, like a tabbar, I can copy it from another screen, or if there's a button that I want to copy in a different position to another screen.</p>

<p>2C) IMPORTANT: creating an import procedure would be great. No we can export a user configuration for offline installation. With an import procedure, we can use the export function for backup too. I can create some backups while I work (yes, I know there's an auto save function, but is not the same), and restore it when I suppose is the time to restart from a milestone I created.<br/>
In this way I can use an interface for another installation importing it from a backup, or create an iPad interface starting from an iPhone interface with all my items inside. So I need only to move items in a different space and resize screens...</p>

<p>Thank you for the attention!</p>

<p>Agreed on the import function. Will look at how it can be managed after some other modifications have gone in first.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out the issue on saving tab bars into a template. Copy &amp; Paste has also been suggested before.</p>
