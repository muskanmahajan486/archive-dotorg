				    <p>I'm currently working on providing some basic support for VoIP in OR and more specifically using it with a Mobotix T24 door entry station.<br/>
The basic functional scenario is:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>somebody rings at the door</li>
	<li>all OR consoles are notified / ring</li>
	<li>user picks up on one console, others stop ringing and user can see person at the door and have audio conversation</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to achieve that, the following changes will be done:</p>

<p>The controller will act as a SIP registrar and proxy, so that the T24 and consoles can register with the controller.<br/>
When somebody rings at the door, the T24 calls the controller. The controller proxies the call in parallel to all registered consoles.<br/>
When one console picks up, the controller establishes the call between T24 and that console and cancels the other call requests.</p>

<p>This mechanism is implemented using a SipServlet.<br/>
The web container must thus be extended to provide SipServlet support. We are using mobicents 1.7 on top of Tomcat in the runtime distribution for this controller.</p>


<p>The console now needs to embed a SIP/VoIP client.<br/>
I'm currently developing that into the iOS console for now. It can be extended to support the other consoles in a further stage.<br/>
It needs to:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>(SIP) register to the controller</li>
	<li>receive SIP call signaling information (ringing, hangup, ...)</li>
	<li>handle the audio streams during the call</li>
</ul>


<p>To achieve this, we're using the <a href="http://www.linphone.org/">linphone</a> library.</p>

<p>There however needs to be a way for the SIP client in the console to communicate with the UI.</p>

<p>There should be commands to allow UI elements to:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>pickup a call</li>
	<li>hangup</li>
	<li>mute (on, off, toggle) the audio stream</li>
</ul>


<p>There should also be commands/sensors to query the call status (ringing, in call, no call) and the mute status. Additional information such as caller name can also be provided.</p>

<p>To implement those aspects, I would propose to support client side versions of commands and sensors (of protocols really). This is described in more detail in this <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Implementing+client+side+protocols">thread</a>.</p>

<p>There currently is no handling of sound (playing, streaming, recording) in the consoles and so in a first phase, these aspects of VoIP would be handled in a specific way.</p>

<p>Can you please tell me what the latest status of OR with regards to the Door station and SIP development is.<br/>
I am looking into putting something together as a door station which can be communicated with through the OR console.<br/>
The T-24 is becoming obsolete and was also too expensive. Wiring seems impractical as well.<br/>
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated</p></font>

Isn't it possible to connect to an asterisk server from the device (e.g. Ipad)?<br/>
Would be really usefull for ip door phone.</p>
