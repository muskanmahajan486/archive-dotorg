				    <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>using a fixed timer in a rule looks like this:</p>

<p>rule "Turn light off after 10s"<br/>
	timer (int: 10s)<br/>
when<br/>
	Event(source=="LED ON/OFF", value=="on")<br/>
then<br/>
	System.out.println("LED turned off after 10 seconds");<br/>
	execute.command("LED OFF");<br/>
end</p>


<p>Now I have created a slider ("Slider - Timer") which brings back via a sensor a number between 0...60. How can I bring this value into the timer, so that I can set the timer time in a flexible way?</p>

<p>rule "Turn light off after 0...60s"<br/>
	Range(source == "Slider - Timer", $timer01 : value)<br/>
	timer (int: $timer01)<br/>
when<br/>
	Event(source=="LED ON/OFF", value=="on")<br/>
then<br/>
	System.out.println("LED turned off after 10 seconds");<br/>
	execute.command("LED OFF");<br/>
end</p>

<p>FYI, this rule does not work, but what is the correct syntax?</p>

<p>Thanks for putting your rules example on here.</p>

<p>I've tried to use it in my design to get a timer to count down days while I'm away, so that my house wakes up again as I return.</p>


<p>For some reason when I load this version in, all my rules stop.</p>

<p>I know I've done something daft with it, but I just can't see the problem.</p>


<p>Can you spot anything?</p>

    iTl = iTl - 1 ;
    execute.command(<span class="code-quote">"Holiday_Days set"</span>, iTl );
end

</pre>
</div></div>


<p>"Holiday Days" is a sensor attached to an in memory command that has a value set from a slider.<br/>
This works because I have the sensor shown on the panel.</p>

<p>Just for information,</p>

<p>I'm running OR1.3, with Java 1.6 on a Windows 7 Netbook.</p>


<p>Many thanks in advance.</p></font>

<p>I had a problem to solve since I moved into this house.. putting trash into the outdoor trash bins in the dark. I needed a light to even see the bins, but I'd forget to turn it off. Long before I heard Z-Wave I changed the light switch to have a mechanical timer. That twisty type that tick tick ticks til it gets to zero and clicks off. But that meant the light would be on for 10+ mins, for a 20 second task. So then I thought, I know, I'll spend about $70 to save 9 mins of electricity a day! </p>

<p>I added a Aeon Z-Wave Microswitch behind that mechanical one. Then slapped on a door sensor. Now I can turn the light on just by opening the door AND it stays on for only 20 seconds. If I need it longer, the mechanical timer switch (OR the phone app,) turns it on/off. Most importantly, if I twist the mechanical, the light does NOT turn off after 20 seconds.</p>

then
    execute.command(<span class="code-quote">"VirtualTimedRearBackDoorLightStatus"</span>, 20 );
end

</pre>
</div></div> 

<p>Very simple. Door Sensor sets a timer value (instead of a slider doing that,) leaving off, on, or decrement Rules to be pretty much the same. Two additions: 1) Door Sensor doesn't initiate this if the switch is already on (from the mechanical,) therefore it doesn't shut off automatically; 2) adding "IsNight" to the equation so that the light only comes on automatically if it's night. </p>

<p>That's a very impressive set of rules you've created.</p>

<p>I'm afraid to say, all of which are beyond me.</p>


<p>However... I have got similar actions and conditions setup in my home, and a number of client's homes, but they are far easier to create using Velbus hardware.</p>

<p>That said, Velbus isn't really a retro fit technology like ZWave and other 'wireless' technologies.</p>


<p>Personally speaking, I really like the way that OpenRemote can sit above a combination of hardware and create some pretty amazing solutions.</p></font>

(Bluetooth MESH will be available in 2016 and that will be interesting Zwave/zigbee competition.) Where's support for a Zigbee dongle? Or Lutron support for SmartBridge (vs the antique Homeworks) ?</p>

<p>Even Z-Wave is under represented. Products released a year ago still have no utility via OpenRemote.</p>

<p>I suspect the answer to ALL of the above is money. ZWave is costly to Develop. Same with Lutron. They reveal their API only to "Partners" and I assume that's a money gateway.</p>

<p>I really wish we could zoom by this era, this proprietary phase, and move straight to the days when the protocol isn't the #1 purchasing decision. </p>

How many outages wireless vs how many wired? I think the cable TV people would be the best source of those numbers. Can't remember how many times I've changed an connector on my cable system, but "lots."</p>

<p>I also think there's a HUGE difference between a 300 ft mesh of Zwave/Bluetooth/Zigbee wireless and 2km Cell service. I have been amazed by the reliability of my first use of Zwave - An under stair closet. I installed a battery operated door sensor and a Zwave wall socket (with wall mounted light strip plugged in.) I assumed it would be slow to turn on and would work 50%. I lived for 3 years without a light in there so 50% seemed ok at the time. Now, if it didn't work everytime, I'd pull some (more) hair. It's been installed for at least a year, and I have never seen it fail. And it works in the half second range. Open the door, the light goes on. Close the door, it goes off. Amazing!</p>

<p>Same goes for the Pico Remotes. I got the first one and thought it would work 50%. And initially I was ok with that. It was for a printer's power. I could hear it switch on or off, so clicking the Pico's button 2-3 times didn't seem like a big deal. Again, it's never failed. Same half second response too.</p>

<p>That's Lutron ClearConnect to the Hub, then Zwave out of the hub to the power socket. Amazing!</p></font>

<p>Carrying on with my holiday countdown thing, can anyone help me again please?</p>


<p>The whole countdown thing works really well with a slider, or even better with some preset buttons that simply set the virtual command to a value.</p>

<p>But there is a situation where the slider isn't accurate enough and the presets don't hold the values I need.</p>


<p>So, what I thought about was adding a +1 day and -1 day pair of buttons.</p>


<p>The only way I could think of doing this was to put two in memory switches on the panel, then get a pair of rules to monitor the state of these switches and add or subtract a day from the in memory value.<br/>
(As well as switching off the in memory switch)</p>



<p>I've tried the following rules, but with no luck.</p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by accurate. IIRC you can use the slider for a coarse setting, and fine tune that with the icons on top or bottom of a veritcal slider. In <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~pz1/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+Optimise+electricity+usage+-+Solar">this draft howto</a> I did use only the top and bottom icons to set the hour that the dishwasher should start. (somewhere half way the page)</p>

<p>The problem with OR sliders often is the sluggish behaviour. I still have on my todo list a slider to an In memory Virtual Command. Leave a bit of time to manipulate the setting, and fire a command after that time has expired. Not nice for dimming lights, but useable for setting thermostats.</p></font>

<p>I didn't realise the top and bottom icons had events associated with them.</p>

<blockquote><p> fine tune that with the icons on top or bottom of a veritcal slider</p></blockquote>


<p>I'll give that a try as it would be a really simple solution.</p>
