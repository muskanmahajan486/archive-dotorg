				    <p>Hello, </p>

<p>After "10 Step to Make Your Business More Eco-Friendly", <br/>
this is also an article talk about green office issue. </p>

<p>"Implementing these steps at an enterprise level, as you would a core business concept, can dramatically change the environmental impact of your entire corporation." </p>

<p>1.) Create Rooftop Green Spaces <br/>
These spaces are often the first step a company might take to begin to make a building more eco-friendly. They are relatively easy to convert and are available at various levels of investment. Rooftop green spaces are generally categorized three ways: intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive. Intensive, although the most costly due to the frequent inclusion of irrigation systems, is also the most effective at conferring benefits. These roofs are constructed by adding a thick layer of growing substance to the roof, and then planting shallow rooting, drought resistant plants. Depending on the strength of the roof, and the quality of watering systems, trees and shrubs can also be planted. </p>
