<p>Hi all,<br/>
I am a newcomer to home automation. Actually I have no experience yet whatsoever, however, I am intrigued by the possibilities.<br/>
For a newcomer like me, it would be incredibly useful if there would be something like a comparison matrix which would give an overview of advantages and disadvantages of the different existing standards. The more choice one has, the more time it takes to come to a decision. So in general I think it is useful to offer guidance in this process.<br/>
I was thinking that such a matrix should at least contain information on whether or not a standard is well documented; whether or not it is supported by openremote; and advantages/disadvantages of the standard, such as the possibility of interference and other pros and cons of the standard (as a newcomer I do not yet have a good idea of what is important).<br/>
I think it would be best if such a matrix would be relatively short and simple. Explanations of why certain qualities are a pro or con can be listed below the table.<br/>
It would also be nice if the table would link to a list with manufacturers, so that as soon as someone has made an informed decision regarding the standard he wants to use, it is possible to see which manufacturers make products using the standard.<br/>
At the moment I do not have any devices that can be used in a home automation system and this type of information might help me and other newcomers to finally enter this interesting domain.<br/>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Bolawy,</p>

<p>Good ideas, without a doubt. It's unlikely any one person is able to put together a full matrix across all different products, vendors and protocols but is something that might be possible as a community effort.</p>

<p>If in your research into home automation you come across information you think is relevant and would like to share with everyone else, feel free to use our <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/knowledge">knowledge base</a> and create pages there (it should be open to everyone to create content there). Information there could eventually lead to such a matrix as you talk about (we should have a pretty good handle on KNX, X10 and Insteon already).</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Actually, I was suggesting to start with only the protocols. Right now, I can find info on each of them individually, but there is no good way to compare them. Creating a comparison matrix with all available products is probably too much, even if all users of openremote would contribute.</p>

<p>I made a page just to illustrate what I mean, but I still miss the knowledge to actually create something useful (feel free to delete it, it's mostly meant as an illustration, much more than a real start). I think it would be useful if something like the 10 most important qualities of a protocol would be represented (from an open source perspective). That way, someone like me could almost instantly get a feel for the differences between protocols. Some information is already available, but it is hard to compare, since it is not written in the same format and also it is not on the same page.<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
