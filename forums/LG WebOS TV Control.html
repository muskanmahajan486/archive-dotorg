				    <p>Hi all</p>

<p>It's been a while - but I'm still here/lurking.</p>

<p>Current project is to forcibly get a 2014/2015 LG WebOS based TV to talk to OpenRemote.  This is not 100% possible, as whilst it has an ethernet socket, when the TV is in standby, it shuts down connections, so I'm still reliant on IR (or HDMI CEC) to wake it up.</p>

<p>However, when it's up, it has two forms of communication - both websocket based.<br/>
One is for basic commands, the second is a secondary websocket (opened off the primary) to drive the cursor....</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm piggybacking off the shoulders of others, as I've found a node based module to run most of the controls, and I've put some simple "bash" wrappers around them to make them executable via "Shell executable" in OpenRemote.</p>

<p>However, the cursor (left/right/up/down) was very slow, as it required a two stage connection - so I've now written a small node http listener that holds a websocket open, and you can make one single HTTP request to it for a command, which is speeding things up.</p>

<p>If there is any interest, let me know - I'm very much still hacking this together but am willing to share!</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>P.</p>

<p>Node is asynchronous, which makes that kind of thing a right pig.</p>

<p>Then you can run (off the top of my head, I think it's) "npm-install lgtv" and that's the basics done - I can provide some wrapper scripts to call the examples once you get the above done <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>
