				    <p>Good evening,</p>

<p>I have recently started developing a new protocol to integrate with Open Remote.  I went to create the Designer protocol XML file and could not find any options for specifying drop-down values.  Is this feature available?  If not, my team would not mind taking a look at implementing it.  I am a strong believer in simplicity for users, and asking them to enter a value that is REGEX checked will very quickly frustrate my clients.</p>

<p>Edit:<br/>
Furthermore, are there any validation options available based on values entered in other boxes on the New Command screen?<br/>
For example, a snippet of an enum (modified for visibility):<br/>
    DOOR_LOCK(), DOOR_UNLOCK(), DOOR_UNLOCK_LATCHED(),<br/>
    AREA_DISARM_AREA(), AREA_DISARM_24HR(), AREA_DISARM_ALL(), AREA_ARM(), AREA_ARM_FORCE(), AREA_ARM_STAY(), AREA_ARM_INSTANT(),<br/>
    OUTPUT_OFF(), OUTPUT_ON(), OUTPUT_TIMED(),<br/>
    INPUT_BYPASS_REMOVE(), INPUT_BYPASS_TEMPORARY(), INPUT_BYPASS_PERMANENT(),<br/>
    VARIABLE_SET(),<br/>
    REQUEST_STATUS();</p>

<p>As you can see, there are a lot of options but only a few apply to each category.  <br/>
It would not be reasonable to expect the user to remember each of these options; nor even to select from a list showing all of these values (though that would be an improvement).</p>


<p>Any thoughts or assistance would be much appreciated.</p>


<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Tomas.</p>

<p>Do you have any tips for where to go to look at implementing conditional fields?  I haven't looked at the designer code very much at this stage so any assistance would be appreciated.</p></font>

<p>In the meantime, I believe it would be interesting to discuss here already what you would like to implement to enhanced the command creation dialog and how that would translate in the protocol.xml definitions.<br/>
This can also be interesting for others to jump in at the purely functional level and indicate what, as end users, they would think would be useful in that dialog.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Sorry for the delayed reply - spending a lot of time getting everything running.</p>

<p>Without thinking about the technology currently implemented, I would imagine an optimal interface would allow a user to select an option from a box (such as Area, Door) and then have further fields become available to the user in a similar style to a JavaScript form. This is similar behaviour to the current Protocol selection when you are creating a command in the designer.</p>

<p>Another possibility, which is more complicated and will probably require a lot of new functionality, would be displaying a list view of all options at each screen. When an option is chosen, a typical hierarchy is displayed at the top of the screen (Door -&gt; Unlock -&gt; 3) and a list of options under that heading would be displayed.  This means a smoother interface for the user to work with and not having to worry about what happens if a field value previously set is changed after.</p>


<p>Heres a couple of ideas for the XML:</p>

<p>&lt;attr name="record-type" label="Record Type"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Door" id="recTypeDoor"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Area" id="recTypeArea"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Output" id="recTypeOutput"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;validations /&gt;<br/>
&lt;/attr&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;attr name="record-command" label="Record Command"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;!-- Door commands --&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Unlock" dependency="recTypeDoor"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Lock" dependency="recTypeDoor"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Latch" dependency="recTypeDoor"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;!-- Area commands --&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Arm" dependency="recTypeArea"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;option name="Disarm" dependency="recTypeArea"&gt;<br/>
	&lt;validations /&gt;<br/>
&lt;/attr&gt;</p>

<p>You could possibly also group the options into a list, and assign them all the same dependency:</p>

<p>&lt;options names="Unlock,Lock,Latch" dependency="recTypeDoor"&gt;</p>

<p>Edit: the dependency should probably link through the attribute name, makes it more robust but means more xml attributes.</p>
