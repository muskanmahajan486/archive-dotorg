				    <p>I have been able to develop a set of rules that allow me to detect my cell phone on my network. its supposed run at a specific time, but I noticed it ran 5 hours to late.  I also have a rule that is supposed to play music in the morning.. that ran about and hour late.</p>

<p>Is there a way output the date and time without adding sensors, similar to how date and time is displayed in the console window when the controller starts? So far I used System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis()) in the rule to print to the console window.  Unfortunately it prints the time and date in milliseconds and I'm not sure if the outputted value can be formatted easily.  Im trying to avoid adding a date and time sensor since the only place I will actually use the date is in the console window.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>My controller is running on windows xp, its controller snapshot 2.0.1, and I'm using cron timers such as these (cron: 00 10 3 ? * 2-6) and timer (cron: 5/5 * 18-21 * * ?)  </p>

<p>whats odd about this is the timers were working well, until recently.  </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks.  With it now logging I can check if my OS is acting up when rules are supposed to run.</p>

<p>Just had to make sure I added the java libraries and it worked fine</p>

<p>import java.text.Format;<br/>
import java.text.DateFormat;<br/>
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;</p>

<p>don't think I needed the ones below but added them all the same<br/>
import java.io.*;<br/>
import java.util.*;<br/>
import java.lang.Float;<br/>
import java.lang.Object;</p>

<p>For the past 2 days things seems to be running fine but thats with a few Controller reboots.  But its looking promising.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>So I have let it run for the week.</p>

<p>I have found something is off.  But don't know of a way to begin to track down the issue.  My first thought was that the cron timer is adding time to itself somehow.  But it doesn't seem to be consistent.  So maybe its my rules. </p>

<p>Using the logging window I have made a few very simple rules</p>

<p>1. timer (cron: 01 00 12 * * ?) That prints the time and Midnight to log window<br/>
2. timer (cron: 01 00 00 * * ?) that prints the time and Noon</p>

<p>Generally Midnight runs at it should but I have seen Noon being printed at hour 17 and today it did not print anything at that time to the window</p>

<p>A music rule timer (cron: 00 20 7 * * ?) this ran today at 18:56:23<br/>
and another for the lights timer (cron: 00 05 3 * * ?) ran right before 18:56:18</p>

<p>And my main rule that is supposed to run when two values are true.. when a custom sensor = InRange and if a boolean MyCount exists.  Once that happens another boolean is created called CellPhone and Cell Found prints to the Log.  But I have found that Cell Found prints every 5 seconds even when it shouldn't, when MyCount is retracted, below are those three rules I set.  Do you see any issues with them? Should CustomState be Event?  </p>

<p>and I'm using Java 6, (1.6.0_30) </p>

<p>rule "Inject a Counter for Cell Test"</p>

<p>		timer (cron: 00 00 17 * * ?)<br/>
	when	<br/>
		eval(true)<br/>
	then<br/>
		MyCount mycount = new MyCount();<br/>
		insert (mycount);</p>

<p>		DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss");<br/>
		System.out.println(df.format(new Date()) + " | Counter Inserted");<br/>
end</p>

<p>rule "Detect wifi Cell phone in range at night"<br/>
		timer (cron: 5/5 * 18-21 * * ?)<br/>
	when<br/>
		CustomState(source == "Cell_InOut_Custom", value == "InRange") and exists MyCount()<br/>
	then<br/>
		CellPhone cellphone = new CellPhone();<br/>
		DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss");<br/>
		System.out.println(df.format(new Date()) + " | cell found");<br/>
 		insert (cellphone);<br/>
end</p>


<p>rule "Send tasks to start system"<br/>
	when<br/>
		exists CellPhone()<br/>
		$cellphone : CellPhone()<br/>
		$mycount : MyCount()</p>

<p> 	then	<br/>
		retract ($cellphone);<br/>
		retract ($mycount);</p>

<p>		DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss");<br/>
		System.out.println(df.format(new Date()) + " | rectracting cell and count");<br/>
		System.out.println("     Powering on System");</p>

<p>		execute.command("Speak PowerOnLR");<br/>
		execute.command("Power On Z1");<br/>
		execute.command("Power Plasma On");<br/>
		execute.command("setOnC3");<br/>
		execute.command("setOnC2");<br/>
end	</p></font>
