				    <p>I recently purchased the OR KNX app on my iPhone and I have a lot of problems with the backup function via dropbox. I was able to do a couple of backups via dropbox, but after that I could not use the backup function anymore. Every time a clicked on the button "connect to dropbox" the app crashes. If I do the same in the restore function then I could still make a connection to dropbox.<br/>
I read in one of the other posts in the forum that I should try to delete the OR KNX App connection in my dropbox settings. After I removed the OR KNX app in my dropbox settings, nothing worked anymore. At every connection now I get always dropbox.com error 401.<br/>
I already tried removing the app and reinstalling it, but I cannot make a connection to dropbox anymore.<br/>
I would really would like to restore this connection so that I can reload my backup files.<br/>
What can I do to fix this issue?</p>

<p>I don't think OR makers will hjelp you, they keep sell this app, but they have not update it for years!!!!!!!</p>

<p>In some functions, you will se that Controlling not yet available.<br/>
This app is just a fraud....</p>

<p>This app is inclompete.</p>

IIRC, the developer of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/openremote-knx/id306900615?mt=8">full KNX app</a> tragically died in a car accident quite a while ago. As you can see in the link, the latest update is from 3012-10-04, just over a year ago.<br/>
