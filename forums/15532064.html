				    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>this looks like a VERY interesting project to me, but i have some queries.</p>

<p>I've used the demo version of the irule software which seems very similar to openremote (with the $50 down side). However that software allows to you design online and then sync what you have created directly on the device (iphone/ipad). No local server is required. The app comunicates directly with things like the global cache IR emitter and with web controlled things like XBMC.</p>


<p>So, i thought i'd ask:</p>

<p>1 - what is the need for the server?</p>


<p>2 - Is there any plan to allow server-less functionality? Even if its design online, download and then upload manually to device?</p>

<p>The problem i have is that i don't have an always on computer/NAS and i don't plan on getting one either. I have a computer i use for media (XBMC) but i don't turn that on when watching tv. I do however have a global cache device that is always on.</p>


<p>Please bare in mind that i've not installed any openremote stuff yet so please be kind if i've said something dumb <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> , i've just been reading the docs to see if its suitable for me.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading&#33;</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Short answer:</p>

<p>Server is needed for automation. If you want your lights to turn on automatically at 7PM, you don't want to find a remote to press the button yourself to do so. That would only be remote control. Not automation. Or if you'd like to be alerted when the smoke detector goes off while you're away. These are all automation cases.</p>

<p>Remote controlling software like XBMC is a subset of this. It involves commands based on user interaction, not automation. </p>

<p>There's an effort underway to let you install a serverless version for the pure remote control use case.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thankyou Juha, that makes sense.</p>

<p>I hadn't thought about the home automation side of things, probably because i'm not after that.</p>

<p>Good news about work on serverless version becoming available. Being a software engineer myself i know this is a bit of a nasty question but do you have rough timescale? Are we talking weeks/months/years? Sorry&#33;</p>

<p>If you're not willing to divulge that info in a public forum then thats cool. If you don't ask you don't get&#33;</p>


<p>Cheers</p></font>
