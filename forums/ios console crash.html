The reason you get the crash is because that original code was not very strict in the way in managed the view hierarchies, which even if not a good practice, was working fine under earlier iOS SDKs.<br/>
With iOS 5, Apple reviewed the way this worked, exposed publicly a way to manage View Controllers hierarchy and added assertions to ensure you did not mess things up.<br/>
So that original code works fine if compiled with an SDK before iOS 5 (which is not an option these days).</p>

<p>The source code for the iOS console has been moved to Github : <a href="https://github.com/openremote/iOS">https://github.com/openremote/iOS</a><br/>
The idea was to transfer to Github, clean and make ready for iOS 5 and above support, then properly start managing fixes and new features using branches and also make the repo a bit more public.<br/>
However that cleaning phase has been dragging for ages due to lack of ability to commit enough time to it.</p>

<p>So the version currently there compiles and works OK under iOS 7.1 but still has bugs.<br/>
It is however your best option for now if you want to compile a version of the console yourself.</p>

<p>I'm working on and off on it and happy to share any information if you want to take a look at the source code and potentially contribute.</p></font>
