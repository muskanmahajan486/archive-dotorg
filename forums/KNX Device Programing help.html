				    <p>Hi to all!<br/>
I'm a new openRemote user. Actually, I m not that good in programing, I happen to have this as part of my work (thesis). The dead line is far past and I will be greatfull for any help. Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>I m to create some APIs that helps a user to connection to KNX Device Network Using Calimero program codes.  I am using alpha-release of Calimero 2.0 &#8211; Next Generation. The KNX Device network setup contains IP Interface - NI48/21, a BCU unit - Binary Output - UP 562/11,  Push Button Interface - UP 220/03-13 and of course the power unit.   I m to provide the following functions:  </p>

<p>Send command <br/>
the system should provide a method to send commands to a KNX device. For example<br/>
//example 1 = ON, 0= OFF;<br/>
//commandsReal = 1,0;<br/>
//commandsReadeble = ON,OFF;<br/>
private String[] commandsReal;<br/>
private String[] commandsReadable;</p>

<p>Get status:  <br/>
method to obtain the status of a device. <br/>
public String getStatus(int address) throws ConnectionException {}</p>

<p>Device Connected: <br/>
method to verify if a device is connected to the KNX network. <br/>
public boolean deviceConnected(int address) {}</p>

<p>List of devices by Name:  <br/>
provide a method to get all the devices connected to the KNX network by their Names. <br/>
public String[] listDevicesName() {}</p>

<p>List of devices by Adress:  <br/>
provide a method to get all the devices connected to the KNX network by their Addresses. <br/>
public int[] listDevicesAddress() {}</p>

<p>List of devices by Type:  <br/>
provide a method to get all the devices connected to the KNX network by their. <br/>
public String[] listDevicesType() {}</p>

<p>Find new device: <br/>
provide a method to find new devices connected to the network. <br/>
public Device newDevice() {}</p>

<p>device description:<br/>
information of the device connected to the network<br/>
public Device getDeviceDescription (Discoverer d) throws KNXException</p>


<p>For Listing of devices by Adress, I know I can use the following method</p>

<p>ManagementClient mc = new ManagementClientImpl(netLinkIp);		<br/>
IndividualAddress[] ias = mc.readAddress(true);<br/>
if (ias.length &lt;= 1)</p>
<div class="error"><span class="error">Unknown macro: {System.out.println(&quot; Here is the read get device}</span> </div>

<p>But the device has to be in programming mode. How do I set the prog Bit so that it switch to programming mode. </p>

<p>Any help to provide these set of method will be appreciated. Thanks </p>

<p>I am lucky I found your post. I also play with that library Calimero  and I am absolutely junior in KNX. I have a question how did you simulate KNX device and than you are able to connect by using Calimero ?</p>

<p>Thanks </p></font>
