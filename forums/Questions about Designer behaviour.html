				    <p>As a new user the UI designer is a bit counter intuitive for me. I could not fing a manual on the site, so here go my questions:</p>

<p>1) At the top of the UI editor page there is a series of buttons that seem to serve alignment of the layout. I have no clue wat they do. When pushed nothing seems to happen. There are also no tooltips indicating a possible function.</p>

<p>2) In my UI design I added grids afterwards. I dragged the existing elements on the sreen into the cells. Then I noticed that the screen had no data. It appeared that in the drag operation all the previously selected sensors had disappeared.</p>

<p>3) I defined my first panel as a WEB console of 1024*800 dots. I had hoped thqat this would give me an almost full screen in the WEBconsole, just as I had seen on some of the fancy movies on site about an office space. However I only got some dull mimiced phone layout to look at. It also did not have my specified dimensions. Afterwards I couyld not changed that dimensions in the panel either. The only solution seems to throw away the panel. <br/>
Is it possible to make a big screen, and if so where can I find instructions/samples?</p>

<p>4) A couple of times with the labels I had selected a sensor by mistake. Unfortunately the designer does not allow to change to an empty field there.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention</p>

<p>1) There will be tooltips in a future version, it did not make it to 2.13.x for some technical reason</p>

<p>Some of those buttons only work with multiple items selected (which you can do by clicking on the different items while holding shift, dragging a 'lasso' around multiple elements is on the todo list), those will be disabled if you only select 1 item.<br/>
In order, the buttons do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>align on left border, vertical center, right border, top edge, horizontal center and right edge: the first item you select is the one that "sets the constraint", the others in the selection will be aligned on this one</li>
	<li>make all selected items the same size : again 1st selected item sets the size for the others</li>
	<li>spread evenly on horizontal or vertical axis : move the items so there is identical spacing between all selected items. The leftmost and rightmost items determine the total space which will be used to spread the items. It seems the behaviour is a bit weird currently if this defines a space that is not big enough for all items to fit. I'll take a look at that later</li>
	<li>center horizontally or vertically : places the item (or items = the whole selection) in the center of the screen (it should also take into account the fact that there is a tab bar).</li>
</ul>


<p>2)I did reproduce it, it's a bug and I logged that in our issue tracking system.</p>

<p>3) Don't know much about the web console, but will look at possibility to resize panels in the designer, makes sense.</p>

<p>4) In my TODO list, along with possibility to remove commands from buttons, ...</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for sending me your files and your PDF is very detailed, well done for making the effort.</p>

<p>You have two options for sizing in the Web Console using the green pull out on the left hand side: -</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Fullscreen mode - No frame around the console and the orientation is changed to match your screen (if your monitor is widescreen then the console will be rotated sideways)</li>
	<li>Specify Size - Height must be larger than width (so as the system always knows which orientation is landscape and which is portrait); if the specified height is too big for your screen then the console will be rotated sideways (you can use the rotate button to rotate it back but note some of the console will be off the screen)</li>
</ul>


<p>From what you have said I believe you want to use the Fullscreen mode but you're wondering why it rotates sideways (this would be to match your screen orientation), when you click the rotate button in fullscreen mode it will load in the opposite orientation of the current screen (if it is defined otherwise it will look like nothing is happening - exactly the same behaviour as you would see on iOS or Android native consoles).</p>

<p>Fundamentally you need to define a landscape version of your screen(s) so that the content will not appear 'sideways'.</p>

<p>As for your layouts becoming distorted, I do not see this behaviour; I have checked with firebug and everything matches your panel.xml sizes no matter what console size setting I use.</p>

<p>Hope this answers your issue(s).</p>

Thanks for the help. You must have thought "how blind can one be" <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Edit: I have taken a deeper look into my system. The Webconsole is located on D:\OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.1\webapps\webconsole. The files there are dated 2012-03-10. I did check both the experimental 2.0.1 package I got from Marcus, and the official 2.0.0 Webconsole package as it is today on the site. Both ZIP files do not have the webconsole branch. So where can we find the WEBconsole package now?</p>

<p>It seems that the latest Web Console hasn't been added to the controller download which I'm trying to sort out with Juha at the moment, I'm not at home and don't have the tools here to send you a copy but in the meantime you're free to try it out from my home server (you won't be able to search for controllers as the web console is running inside my LAN and discovery only works for current LAN): -</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>As it is shown on screen it has single arrows at the end, which suggest that pressing those areas would result in a gradual move. In practice on Webconsole at one click it goes to the very end. If that is the intended behaviour a double arrow would be more appropriate.</li>
	<li>More important is that the Slider allows for adding 5 user defined images. (MinImage...MaxImage). However the images I specify do not show up in the WEbconsole.</li>
</ul>



<p>Is this a shortcoming of Webconsole, or isn't the display of those images implemented yet?</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>edit: One more thing I noticed since the original posting: The selection frame around the slider is not vertically centered around the slider. If you make it for example 10 points high, it is well above the device. That makes that text labels above the slider are not exactly placed as originally in the design.</li>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Pieter,</p>

<p>Regarding the slider control in the web console; you are right in noting that it does not have the same functionality as the one shown in the Designer. The designer widgets are all generated using the Sencha GWT library where as in the Web Console everything was written from the ground up and I just haven't got round to adding all the same functionality. It is on the list of things to do.</p>
