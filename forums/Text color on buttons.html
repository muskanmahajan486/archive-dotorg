				    <p>I've been trying to improve the look and feel of the interface now that I've included the basic KNX functionality and have run into a bit of a snag. Buttons for iOS have white text and the same buttons for Android have black text, is there a way to fix this?</p>

<p>I guess I could make two grids, one with labels (since you can choose color) and one with invisible buttons. I'm not really looking for the ability to change the colors, I can make the GUI adapt instead, but I would like both platforms to use the same standard color. Is there a way to tweak this in the designer or controller code?</p>

<p>I did try a search but found little information, hopefully I've just missed an easy fix in order to sync this up?</p>

<p>Tnx in advance!</p>

We are currently starting some discussions to make all console look alike but that is not finished yet.<br/>
You could create buttons with images and text layed over.</p></font>

<p>Hmmm, I'm leaning towards doing a solution I saw regarding the android platform having screwed up aspect ratios when comparing designer &lt;-&gt; Android Conole. In the end, the guy made layered images in Photoshop and then just saved them of as flat images when adding to OR, using transparent buttons on top. Maybe that's the route to go in order to leave the actual graphics out of OR and just have it responsible for backend func.</p>

<p>Luckily I haven't gotten that far along in making everything pretty yet, so it's doable.</p></font>
