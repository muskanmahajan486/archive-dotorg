<p>With OpenRemote Designer you can create screens for different resolutions and therefore handle each device's individual needs. This works for residential installations where panel dimensions are known and the variety is limited.</p>

<p>For certain large-scale commercial installations however, the use case might be where users pop in and out with their own personal devices. For these use cases developing further our screen adjustable layout managers in OR Designer makes sense. In some cases residential installations will benefit too, where same design scales to different screen resolutions. The drawback is however that you are not taking advantage of the larger screen real estate. Whether that is desired or not depends very much on individual use case.</p>
