				    <p>Hello,<br/>
I am a newbie to OR. Although I understand a little bit of java.<br/>
1. I have been trying to get OR interact with a telnet interface (Misterhouse if that helps)</p>

<p>Turned on debug logging and see that OR sends the On command successfully and it gets executed.<br/>
I also see that OR sends the status command right and gets a "on" or "off" response back. But it fails to update the switch.<br/>
Here is the console output:</p>

<p>How do I fix this?</p>

<p>2. I see that the polling cycle is every half a second. It is a little too incessant for the MH server and  I read in another forum post where I can change it in the code and rebuild the project. <br/>
But the svn tree seems very confusing. The trunk has a comment which says "no longer needed". What branch is the latest code release built from. I would want to start there or a dev branch that is up to date.</p>

I was able to get my debugger to show me the problem I had and able to get everything to work after getting the correct source tree.<br/>
In case you are interested when there is no regex filter specified my filteredResponse variable was getting the value "on\n" or "off\n". Which was not getting converted to boolean properly in TelnetCommand.java</p>

<p>So instead of add a regex to all my already defined commands I just added to the TelnetCommand.java a single line to strip newlines and everything worked great after that.</p>

<p>filteredResponse = filteredResponse.toLowerCase().replaceAll("1|on", "true");<br/>
//Next line is new<br/>
filteredResponse = filteredResponse.replaceAll("(\\r|\\\n)", ""); </p></font>
