				    <p>I've be using OR for a little while, but by no means a pro, but I have successfully been able to control my system. Recently I hit a brick wall.  I'm using Acer A500 tablet, and each time I try to sync up to the controller, it says the Current controller isn't available.  Using cached content.  Normally I disregard because everything will still work after pressing OK.  This time around and ever since I revised a panel, I can not get a panel to load at all.  </p>

<p>I attempted to clear the controller cache but I get "Failed to reload configuration and clear cache!"  so  I opted redeployed a new controller, But no luck.<br/>
Then I attempted to clear the image cache in the Android app.<br/>
Then I cleared the application data directly from the device to force the panels to load (this ended up crashing the Android app whenever it opened "the application OpenRemote(process org.openremote.android.console) has stopped unexpectedly).<br/>
Then I reverted back to Beta2 from Beta3 to see if I could get some better results</p>

<p>All of which I was unsuccessful.  </p>

<p>I'm thinking that my panel data is to large when zipped, it totals 6megs is it possible that the size is causing the initial load to timeout?  I also reduced the amount of sensors to ease the polling traffic, but still no luck.   </p>

<p>I'm using port 9000 for the controller, no SSL, and nothing seems to pop out at me in the logs</p>

<p>Any Suggestions? </p>

<p>Did you ever solve this? I think I have the same problem with two new 7" Android tablets that i have bought. Same designer config file works perfectly on an iPhone, but I hit the problems you describe above on Android.... <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>thanks</p></font>

I recently tried to update the controller to the release listed  <a href="http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20449709&amp;focusedCommentId=20450823#comment-20450823">here</a> but I still cant seem to get in to the app.  On Beta2 the error is There's no controller server,  However it auto-discovers the port and panel in the settings of the app. Beta3 auto-detects but crashes too.</p>

<p>so I may just wait it out until the next version, I have another app I can use, its just not as powerful.</p>

<p>So the bad news is I cannot reproduce the error.</p>

<p>This could mean any of the following:</p>

<p>1) there's still something that has gone wrong with the software install, either the controller or the android APK (I tested with the Beta 3)</p>

<p>2) There's some incompatibility in the android hardware you're using vs. the one I tested with (Samsung Galaxy phone)</p>

<p>3) Perhaps different Android versions cause the issue.</p>

<p>Can't really say anything more right now, and difficult to debug without being able to reproduce the error. Sounded like you already tried reinstalling. Which device and android version are you using?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for the Kudo's.  Yeah I tried reinstalling and I just moved back to Beta3, I'm running Android 4.0.3 on an Acer A500.<br/>
I just tried to see if I get the panel to load on the webconsole, and that seems to work.  Unfortunately I don't have another android device to test since I'm using a WP7.</p>

<p>Is there a way to manually load the panel images to the device, without it being rooted.  I have a feeling that would work since the process of loading the panel is where it tends to crash, checking local storage it will only get to 8Kb then crash.</p>

<p>Anyhow.. thanks for the assistance.</p></font>

What I ended up doing was deleting a few of the panels and templates that I had in the designer.  I think a few of those were corrupted. Then I started to rebuild some panels to get rid of the duplicate button images.  I also removed some sensors that I was using with MCE controller.  I have not had much crashing since.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi All</p>

<p>I have this exact problem - Android crashing on panels load. In fact, I have reported it elsewhere in this forum under conversations relating to Raspberry Pi. I have three Android Panels and they all work flawlessly (ish) when the controller is on my PC. When the controller is on the Pi I get this problem.</p>

<p>As per comment by J Gastile above, who removed some panels and the situation improved, this is my experience also on the Pi.... that had me thinking that it was a memory or CPU grunt problem on the Pi - but i was never really that convinced.</p>

<p>I also think there may be some correlation with a similar problem I have experienced on iPhone. on iOS, sometimes when loading a panel for the first time, it throws a graceful error "Cannot Load Image &lt;xxx&gt;". You have to continually load/reload the panel until all graphics get loaded... however, it is possible (I am speculating here) that the Android handles this same problem differently by putting it's legs rather ungainly in the air.</p>

<p>I'm still hoping this is not a Pi problem, and that it's a bug. I would love to have my Pi as an always on system, but currently it cant cope with my 3 Panel, 15 Group and 25 Screen layouts. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>
