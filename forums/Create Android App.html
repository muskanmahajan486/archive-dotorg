				    <p>Sorry Nooby Questions</p>

<p>I've managed to build my simple remote app using the designer and have got it working on my phone using the app from the Playstore.</p>

<p>The trouble is my laptop has to be on etc, etc. I want to run it as a standalone app. I've started going through the Building OpenRemote Android 2.0 Console on the site. I can get as far as Android list targets and get a reply but that is as far as I can get.</p>

<p>From there on I don't have the slightest clue what to do. Been trying loads of different combinations, my best result so far has been</p>

<p>android update project --subprojects --target android-18 --name OpenRemote --path <a href="http://svn.code.sf.net/p/openremote/code/tags/project/Android_Console/Android_Console_2_0_0_Alpha1/">http://svn.code.sf.net/p/openremote/code/tags/project/Android_Console/Android_Console_2_0_0_Alpha1/</a></p>

<p>But am getting. ERROR: failed to combine working directory C:\Users\................ with project location <a href="http://svn.code.sf.net/">http://svn.code.sf.net/</a>............... The filename, directory name, or volume syntax is incorrect.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance and expect loads of other questions for the next bit <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>You won't get Android code to run on Windows, unless you run it within the emulator - which would be a bit overkill, although it might work in theory.</p>

<p>I've got a couple of "shortcuts" linked up with the REST API, so I can send commands to OpenRemote via the defined panels I've defined, but without actually using a physical panel device (but I'm using that for voice control)</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>The Android console is just a client.  You'd need to build the server component, not the console, and then tell the console to use the loopback (127.0.0.1) address to talk to itself, as the server..... </p>

<p>In theory (given the server is Java based) you could run something like JBED to try to run it on the phone...</p>

<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2325619">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2325619</a></p>

<p>However, if it's on a phone, odds are you will (quite often) not be at home, and your device will not be on your home WiFi, and thus the commands won't work - and anything you write which needs status polling (i.e. get the current brightness of a Hue Bulb) will just 'fail' until you're back on the network.  So not quite sure why you'd want to do that unless you can't run a server at all?</p>

<p>I run my server at home and have a VPN so I can access it over VPN when out and about - or you could do what some others are talking about and port forward from outside back to your server and implement Apache user/pass (.htaccess) security.</p></font>
