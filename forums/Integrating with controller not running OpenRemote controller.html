				    <p>Hello Community,</p>

<p>I have a home controller that exposes its interface via http/xml (all signals on one URL) and accepts http POST requests for individual commands.<br/>
I have not tried yet OpenRemote with it but, as it seems, OR has essential set of features to handle this.<br/>
Two things which are not clear for me yet and I would appreciate if you explain or point me to the right place in the documentation.</p>

<p>1. For authentication my controller uses cookies. If the cookie is missing or expired the controller forwards to the login page.<br/>
I could not find any provision on the HTTP command page for the cookie. How does an OR panel works with cookies?</p>

<p>2. Every time when I flash new configuration, the XML is shuffled a bit and the UI needs to be updated to match with the new command definitions.<br/>
Doing manual entry of the commands every time does not look exciting to me, I would prefer to write some conversion scripts from the controllers XML to the OR controller.xml<br/>
However, I could not find an option for uploading controller.xml to the composer. Is it possible?</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Eugene</p>
