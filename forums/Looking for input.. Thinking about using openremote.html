				    <p>I have been looking at a lot of different options for HA and this one appeals to me greatly.&nbsp;&nbsp; However I wanted to get a little feedback from people that have already used it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to set up something where I can have output on my 60" TV via HDMI.&nbsp; Kind of like the Control4 product does.&nbsp;&nbsp; Has anyone done this? Or is it possible with openremote in its current state?&nbsp; I am a senior software engineer so I am not afraid to get my hands dirty to help it happen but I am wondering if anyone has done it already?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Michael</p>

OpenRemote consoles (iOS, Android and web-based so far) are optimized for touchscreens. I don't see how you could navigate through the interface with a remote as Control4 solutions. However if you're software developer you could write an extension for XBMC or Media Center. The OR API is REST and XML based and simple enough.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone has done something similar with OR so far.</p></font>

<p>Appreciate the offer to help &#8211; it's a bit unclear to me what it is you're trying to do though, you want to stream media to your TV?</p></font>
