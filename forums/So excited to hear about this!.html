				    <p>About <em>8 years ago</em>, Michael Earls presented at the Atlanta C# Developers User Group.  He demonstrated his X10 automation project where he had integrated XP Media Center edition and a web server in his home.  He had two interesting demonstrations: </p>
<ol>
	<li>engage a camera on his porch when the doorbell triggered an event on his controller and display the feed inside Media Center on his Tv.</li>
	<li>turn a lava lamp on or off by sending an email, from his blackberry, to an account pop'd by his home server.  The server would then call his laptop via a web service and turn the lamp, sitting in front of us in the presentation room, on.</li>
</ol>


<p>To this day people still chuckle by how impressive it was that he sent an email and that lava light turned on more than a minute later.  <em>Stunning</em>!  I jest but we all glimpsed something very innovative that day.  It was an exploration into a future technology that lacked a viral community and solid user interfaces devices.  </p>

<p>Since then I have had a dream of becoming a home automation expert but the cheesy reputation and behavior of X10, all that spam and intrusive interstitial offensiveness, squashed my confidence and motivation to take it further.  I didn't, and still don't, trust that company and haven't found a solid resource that could help me get my feet wet.  Until now!</p>

<p>To see who is behind this project is remarkable!  Proven open source heavy weights who can truly wade through the cruff to bring something polished and accessible forward, committed to community and software excellence and technology advancement.  Wow.  Thanks y'all.  I'm following.  I'll be putting together the components as soon as possible.  I'll contribute what I can.</p>

<p>Thanks again.  I just wanted you to know how genuinely excited I am to find this. ROck ON!</p>

<p>Thank you for the very encouraging words. A little cheering can go a long way at times. We are putting together a milestone "play-release" to share with the community. And hope we can restore your confidence in home automation. Stay tuned...</p>

We did it with an AT&amp;T 3B1/Unix PC, UUCP (there was internet as we no it today back then) and the CP290 interface. Unfortunately X10 remained the predominate HA protocol until this century (wow that seems odd to say). There are a lot of new products but nobody wants to play together. I see the OpenRemote community getting everyone together and playing nice. There's work to do but it can be done and the time is right (despite the economic mess).</p></font>
