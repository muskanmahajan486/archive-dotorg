				    <p>Hello&#33;</p>

<p>I am looking into Open Source HA solutions, and I've (obviously) stumbled across OpenRemote. I'm a technical user with programming and Linux experience, so I am not intimidated by the product, but I am trying to determine if OpenRemote is the solution for me. I intend to find an HA solution that utilizes a web based interface for control, as I do not have an iPhone and do not intend to purchase one.&nbsp; Is OpenRemote still the appropriate solution for me? How does the extensibility of OpenRemote look if I wanted to build some Windows apps that utilize the services?</p>

<p>Secondly, when looking at HA devices, what is recommended? X10? Insteon? Z-Wave?</p>

<p>Thanks&#33;</p>

<p>Regarding Windows app, you can build Win32 console that utilizes the HTTP/REST API that we provide.</p>

<p>HA devices, very much an individual choice. We recommend devices that have ability to integrate with an IP-based network (IP-to-IR, IP-to-Serial, IP-to-KNX, etc.).</p>

<p>Haven't had time to look into Insteon support yet (only works in the US) though there's a reasonable bridge there to IP from Universal Devices (ISY-99). Same with Z-Wave &#8211; know some IP-to-Zwave products in development but haven't had time to test yet.</p>

<p>(sorry for delay, forums were broken).</p>
