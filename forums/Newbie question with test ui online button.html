				    <p>I've installed the controller on an old XP laptop and got it up and running today. I have all my iTach commands in now and put together some macros to handle swapping between roku and my base cable tuning and etc. I would like to test some of the simple buttons I've placed to try the power macro for example to power up both AV amp and TV with a single macro. When I press the "test UI online in your panel" button in the designer I get a dialog with this text:</p>


<p>To test your UI without installing any Controller or deploying configuration, type the following URL into your panel setting as Controller URL :</p>

<p><a href="http://beehive.openremote.org/3.0/alpha5/rest/user/">http://beehive.openremote.org/3.0/alpha5/rest/user/</a>&lt;myOpenRemoteLogin&gt;</p>

<p>My question is where do I find the "panel setting as Controller URL" thing that the dialog mentions?</p>

<p>I am impressed with what I've seen so far with this software. I was able to sync my local controller with the cloud with no apparent issue. I have not tried stopping and restarting the local controller yet since it looked like the options on sync page pretty much reconfigured the controller on the fly.... Again I am impressed with that. Most java softwares I've dealt with are not that robust and require a lot of manual start stop reconfigure restart blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help or suggestions,</p>

<p>A bit more searching in the forum yielded:</p>

<p><a href="http://openremote.org/display/docs/Building+OpenRemote+2.0+Web+Console">http://openremote.org/display/docs/Building+OpenRemote+2.0+Web+Console</a><br/>
At the bottom it tells how to start the web console and from there I clicked add controller and I have a panel with four inputs:<br/>
1. Controller URL<br/>
2. Default Panel Name<br/>
3. Username<br/>
4. Password</p>

<p>Is this the correct place as I guess?</p>

<p>Okay, that allows me to run my UI from my localhost URL. The syncing to the cloud based designer is working apparently. But when I attempt to run the resulting webconsole UI off of it I get this in the "logs/dev/dev.log" file:</p>

.<br/>
.<br/>
etc.</p>

<p>Looks like something is going horribly wrong in telnet command sending. These commands work perfectly in putty and in iTest tool by pointing them at my iTach ip and port number. Also I've tried the command with and without the \x0d figuring it was the command terminator missing or something. Did NOT help. Can anybody shed some light here?</p>

<p>Okay, I've found that changing those telnet commands to tcpip type allows the communication with the iTach device to go ahead. Ergo I can now get the devices to respond to SOME macros I've devised. Others not so much. Example the reconfiguration of the inputs on my sony AV amp are working fine but the needed adjustments to the sharp tv inputs which requires sending multiple commands in order to work is working for moving to input #4 but not to input#0. I could have committed a copy paste error while fiddling with the iLearn utility I suppose. I will retest my command strings in putty session and make sure they are correct. I will provide more info as it becomes available.</p></font>
