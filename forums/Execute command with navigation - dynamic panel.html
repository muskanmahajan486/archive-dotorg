				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>here is what I want to achieve: create remote control panel which will change dynamically depending on a system state. For example, two buttons - audio and video. When I press audio button then I want the panel to have all audio controls AND switch the audio system on. Vice versa with video button. I want also that panels change when I switch system through external remote or manually. So buttons need to have sensors (like Switch widget) and navigation (like Button widget). I'm stuck here as no single widget combines them (i.e. sensor+command+navigation), and I want to keep my UI as simple as possible, so no combining labels (as sensors) with buttons as command &amp; navigation. Is it currently possible?</p>

<p>Michal</p>

I.e. is it something that can be done quite easily or is it extremely hard because of the current software architecture? If first option is true then I would be eager to implement the change myself as this would enable me to create really cool remote which I haven't seen yet but wish to have <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

<p>I am interested as well in triggering a navigation page with a sensor or a rule. Is there any progressing on this topic?</p>

<p>At the moment i get myself into OpenRemote &lt;-&gt; AMX Communication and in AMX i am used to trigger all Page Flips (Navigation) from the Controller. Would be nice to have someting simular in OpenRemote!</p>

<p>Kind Regards</p></font>
