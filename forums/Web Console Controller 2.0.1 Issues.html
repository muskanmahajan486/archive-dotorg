				    <p>Some users have reported issues with the Web Console getting stuck at the Loading screen when trying to connect to their controllers.</p>

<p>The only possible cause of this I am aware of is if you are using security on your controller and you are using Controller version 2.0.1 or older.</p>

<p>Due to issues with the Controller REST API the Web Console won't be able to connect to Controller versions 2.0.1 or older; I created a few patches to fix the problem which will probably be included in Controller 2.1.0.</p>

<p>In the meantime I have a Controller branch in my workspace that has the patches applied which you can use but this is based on Controller 2.0.0: -</p>

<p><a href="https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/workspace/richturner/Controller_2_0_0_patched">https://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openremote/workspace/richturner/Controller_2_0_0_patched</a></p>

<p>I've also compiled this branch and put it on my server so you can download the zip from there if you'd rather: -</p>

<p><a href="http://multimation.co.uk:8080/controller/OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.0_Patched.zip">http://multimation.co.uk:8080/controller/OpenRemote-Controller-2.0.0_Patched.zip</a></p>

<p>This should allow you to use the Web Console with a secured Controller.</p>

<p>Above all the 50 EUR 7" Android 4.0 is working too. And it allows me to edit the controller settings.<br/>
Great!</p>

<p>I call it the day now. Shouldn't push it too much. Tomorrow I will see to get it working on Synology (where I wasted most of my time today). I guess has to do with access rights.</p></font>

<p>...i still don't quite understand what this "security enabled" means. I don't have the "zip file upload security" thingy enabled in the designer so it shouldn't be about that..</p>
