				    <p>Hi everybody, </p>

<p>there are two things I would like to report regarding the latest webConsole version (<a href="http://multimation.co.uk:8080/controller/webconsole.war">http://multimation.co.uk:8080/controller/webconsole.war</a>)</p>

<p>1) For on/off sensors that use two different images depending on their state, both images are visable at the same time. There is no switching between them. It works with the very old alpha1 release of the webconsole thus it seems like an issue of the new one. </p>

<p>2) I noticed that a couple of my "navigate to" buttons are not working anymore. It is weired, only some of them have no effect, others work fine. Again, I doublechecked my design using the alpha1 webconsole version. There, all navigate to commands work fine. </p>

<p>Any ideas on that? </p>

<p>Thanks and a good evening to everyone.</p>

<p>Alex</p>
