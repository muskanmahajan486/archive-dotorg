				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am new to OR and trying to set up a system using a Raspberry PI as a controller and an Android tablet (Huawei Mediapad) as the remote device.</p>

<p>Setting up the RPI and the controller worked just fine and syncing etc. works well.</p>

<p>In a first step I want to use my existing panel layouts formerly created in iRule to avoid some of the design work for the beginning.<br/>
I have screenshots of the panels and want to use them as background images in OR in order to place transparent buttons over the button positions of the image.</p>

<p>My problem is that the I can not figure out the correct settings to let the image appear at the right position with correct orientation and size. The image displayed on my Android device appears either way too small (~ 30% missing in height and width) or too big (~ 30% cut off in both directions) depending on the 2 image adjustment settings made available by the 4 arrow icon in the taskbar of the Android app.</p>

<p>Here is what I did:<br/>
Using landscape mode only.<br/>
The resolution of the images match the screen resolution (1024x600) of the device (in fact the height is a bit less to let some space for the taskbar).<br/>
The panel size is set to the screen resolution without any margins (1024x600) and the images are defined as background images of the screens (the "Fill screen" option does not seem to make a difference).<br/>
Therefore I would expect the images to completely fill the screen width and almost the entire screen height.<br/>
I also tried to use image objects instead of setting the image as background images =&gt; same problem.</p>

<p>Could anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?</p>

<p>By the way - is there a way to save the current settings and restore them later? <br/>
There is "Export to zip" button but how can this version be restored?<br/>
Trying different things is very hard without this possibility!</p>

<p>Thx, Chris</p>

As I said it is a Huawei Mediapad with the screen resolution 1024x600.<br/>
