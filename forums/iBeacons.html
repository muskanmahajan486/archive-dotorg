				    <p>Hi All,</p>

<p>Just wondering if there are any plans for iBeacon support. Estimote blipped up on my radar recently after seeing them mentioned on Techcrunch and then a week later at an IBM hosted retail briefing session.</p>

<p>Wondering to myself, that beyond just retail there could be application within the home automation space - OpenRemote records a sequence of commands as a users preference, upon the user entering an iBeacon zone, it triggers the OpenRemote app to replay the preferences for that zone! Lights, Heating, Home Entertainment.</p>

<p>Sounds like a cool idea, thinking I might sign up for a Dev Kit to have a tinker, although it's been a while since I've coded and would be a first in Objective-C.... thoughts on this as an integration?</p>

<p>Stuart</p>

We love to see a contribution on that. We need the community here to help. Anybody else has thoughts?</p></font>

<p>Have not had any of time to play with them and OR, but its very promising.  I was thinking of first tagging a screen with a beacon uuid so when you were in that room, the correct screen would automatically be displayed.  Rules would also be awesome. </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Yes, this is indeed something very interesting with many applications.<br/>
In fact, the idea should be that many "device sensors" should be able to be included in the OR configuration and link to actions or navigations.</p>

<p>"small scale localization" like what's possible with iBeacon should be one.<br/>
Larger scale version like geofencing could be another one.</p>

<p>Please report your progress here and we'll see how we can go further with it and integrate.</p></font>
