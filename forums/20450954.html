				    <p>To start with i'm gonna set up OR as a 'home theatre' remote. I've been using a Harmony for a while which has the idea of activities (eg, watch tv, watch film etc etc). When you start that activity it turns the relevant equipment on and sets up the inputs and what not.<br/>
Should i be pursuing a similar outlook for OR or is there a more recommended approach?</p>

<p>I can easily create macros that could set up each activity and turn unused equipment off.<br/>
I can also create a screen where the buttons correspond to the activity.</p>

<p>However, OR is more functional than a harmony. If i was to add lighting, this would mess up my activities. I wouldn't want the activity start macro to run again if i went from 'watch tv' to 'lighting' and then back to 'watch tv' again.</p>

<p>Also, as there could be more than 1 remote (eg, ipad and iphone) how do i ensure both work with each other rather than against. Eg, ipad select 'watch tv' which sets everything up. Could i then get the iphone to go straight to the 'watch tv' screens? If not, this would mean the iphone would activate the macro (which i don't want) in order to start controlling.</p>


<p>Hopefully that makes sense.<br/>
What does everyone else do?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>To prevent you are mixing up things, I wouldn't use macro's which bring you to a specific UI for a category. So if you watch TV you create a button in the menu which brings you to a category and corresponding UI: TV or Entertainment. Within the UI of the TV, you can add scenes (macro's/rules). So in case of TV UI, you can add a scene "Movie" (eg. a macro which dimms the lighting to 10% and set's the audio to surround sound, switches off the doorbell). If you would navigate back to the category Lighting, you could switch the light of and safely go back to the category TV, without the Lighting changing...</p>

<p>This would also prevent your iPhone mixing up the choice you made on your iPad.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Yes! Great idea. I'm glad someone actually understood my ramblings.<br/>
Also, so simple once you get your head thinking the right way.</p>

<p>So, i think i'll go with a default start page like you say: TV, Movies, Music, Lighting, Gaming. Something like that anyway (my movies and tv use completely different hardware hence splitting them out). I might even have a page before that to select the room.<br/>
Then on each page i'll have a "Start activity" or similar button that does the setup. That way the user can use their noggin to decide whether the activity is already going or not. (Most of my stuff has discrete on/off so re-running the macros would mostly be ok anyway, but its better this way)<br/>
Then i'll modify your "movie" scene idea to be able to switch between normal tv speakers and surround sound.</p>


<p>Thanks very much. I'm away now. Gotta get good at designing panels <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>
