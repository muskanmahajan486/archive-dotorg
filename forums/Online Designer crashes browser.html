				    <p>Maybe I've reached some fundamental limit with my design, but I'm at the point where adding another label or switch to a panel crashes my browser. This crash always happens at the point where I push the button to set sensor for the label or to select the switch command for the switch. At that point, the online designer tries to create a list of sensors or switches for me to choose from. When I push that button, there is a long pause &#8211; sometimes up to a minute &#8211; and then the browser crashes. I've tried this in both Firefox 4.0.1 and Internet Explorer 8. And, I've tried it on multiple different computers. I even tried it with Firefox running both on Windows XP and Linux. The browser crash happens in all cases.</p>

<p>A few details:</p>

<p>I am building panels for iPad. I have about 12 panels defined.</p>

<p>I have a total of 149 commands, 61 sensors, 12 sliders, and 28 switches defined in total, split between two devices.</p>

<p>This is really frustrating. I'm almost at the point where I've got this controller done, but I do need to add perhaps 15% more commands and sensors and some more stuff to the panels. But, I can't do anything at this point because of the online designer browser crashes.</p>

<p>Not sure where to start debugging this (in theory browser should be isolated even from the poorly written Javascript code). Sounds like it might get itself in a busy loop and end up crashing. Do let me know if you find any additional details. Also, I've found Chrome to be able to handle GWT apps by far the best, so if possible to give it a try with Chrome to see if the issue manifests there too, would be helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I did try Chrome, too, after my post, but it also crashes in the same spot.</p>

<p>I tried Firefox and IE8 on a Windows 7 machine. IE8 gave me many "script busy" warnings where I hit continue, and then eventually IE8 reported an out of memory error. Firefox on Windows 7 crashed just like it does on XP and Linux.</p>

<p>Because my project is one that has evolved for the last 6 months, I thought maybe, somewhere along the way, it had picked up junk that maybe was causing the issue. So, during the last day, I've been redoing the project from scratch. I have about as many sensors in the project as before and, so far, it isn't crashing my browser. I'll post an update in a day or two as to whether things are still working when I get the project completely rebuilt.</p>

<p>1) I will see if there's anything revealing in the database logs<br/>
2) We need to start building stress tests on the designer for high number of sensors/commands etc.<br/>
3) Will investigate if we can upgrade the GWT or GXT components and if that would help the issue.</p>

<p>I've started the VM with higher memory limits for now as an immediate attempt to resolve some issues. Will check the database logs too if something pops up.</p>

<p>The dumb part on our side is that the restore on the designer does not fall-back to the panel XML definition which is still there (email me if you need it) which could be used to reconstruct the panels. While panel XML is readable and easily modifiable, the designer restore is in binary format which makes it basically lost once corrupt.</p>

<p>I'll still check your original account to see if I can identify what was the issue there before you started the reconstruction through designer.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for your testing, Juha.</p>

<p>It's hard for me to say exactly why I started to see the crashes. I hadn't done any work with the design for about two months. Then, I needed to add 16 more sensor and associated commands. I picked up the design again and added the new commands and sensors and that's when I found the crashes. So, it could either be software changes in the couple of months since my previous work or it could be the additional sensors. I actually tend to think it is the additional sensors. I do notice that the amount of time to choose a sensor or a switch to apply a label or switch on a panel seems to really start to increase dramatically when the number of defined sensors starts to reach a certain point.</p>

<p>I'll try to do some experiments to see if backing out some sensors will stop the crashes. But, I'm going to be traveling for the next 10 days, so I might not have results to report for a while.</p></font>

<p>I happened to have a Designer account that has 150+ commands, 55 sensors, 26 sliders, 20 switches and I just tried chaging the label sensor on one of my panels and Chrome threw a couple of un-responsive messages and eventually I had to terminate it.</p>

<p>I haven't added any more sensors or anything since I created this designer setup a couple of months ago and things worked then. This leads me to think something has changed since then.</p>

<p>Juha has anything been altered either server side or in the GWT designer code in the past few of months?</p></font>

<p>This is just a stop-gap that improves the performance somewhat but does not eliminate the issue. A proper fix will require further work in analyzing the SQL queries and the data transmission between the DB and designer and maybe even investigating the Javascript generated by the GWT and GXT frameworks.</p>

<p>There seem to be a couple of issues at work here. One is the database query performance &#8211; some minor improvements can be had by not eager-loading data that is not needed and doing lazy fetch strategies instead. However, the schema structure around sensors looks a little odd so refactoring this area may help (selecting commands does not suffer similar performance issues and the designer code there takes a different approach from sensor loading).</p>

<p>But also updating the GXT UI framework had an impact on performance so it may not merely be a DB performance issue but Javascript performance issue as well (there shouldn't be any because the displayed UI is very simple but for some reason the Javascript ends up doing a lot of work).</p>

<p>So the performance will be somewhat dependent on the browser you use &#8211; this seems to be working ok with the Chrome on Macbook Pro. Firefox on the same Mac complains about a slow script &#8211; stopping the script and trying to select a sensor again eventually resolves it (the dialog appears) but is quite a bit slower compared to Chrome so you'll have to wait quite some time.</p>

<p>Also the GXT update broke at least some of the other UI code which will need to be updated before these changes can be deployed on the main version. The proper fix will have to wait for later until have time to do all that is described above.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>By the way, my design could greatly reduce the number of sensors used if it were possible to pass a parameter to the sensor and then down to the command. For example, I have a device that can read 16 switch inputs. Right now, I have 16 separate commands and 16 separate sensors, one for each of the 16 inputs connected to this device. However, I could do this with one command, and one sensor if it were possible at the panel level to specify to the sensor which of the 16 inputs to read and have that sensor pass that parameter on to the command where it would be passed on to the device.</p>

<p>I don't think this is possible right now, but if it is, please let me know. If it isn't, it would make a nice enhancement allowing for a big reduction in sensors and commands for these types of devices.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello John,</p>

<p>The designer at <a href="http://designer.openremote.org/2.0-SNAPSHOT-20110612/">http://designer.openremote.org/2.0-SNAPSHOT-20110612/</a> is back online. Please give it a try.</p>

<p>I tried it with Chrome on Mac and had no more crashing issues.</p>

<p>Also tried with Firefox on Mac &#8211; there the 10 second 'unresponsive script' dialog still pops up. You can increase the delay by going to the address bar and there type 'about:config' then look for the row with 'dom.max_script_run_time' and increase the value from 10 (seconds) to 60 (seconds). This gives the script a little more time to complete before the warning pops up.</p>
