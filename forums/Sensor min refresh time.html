				    <p>Hi - using the staging designer, you are able to set a refresh time for each sensor - <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+1-Wire+Sensors">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+1-Wire+Sensors</a> </p>

<p>Has this feature been merged into an alpha release of the controller - I am currently using Controller_2_0_0_Alpha11.  As far as I can see it's not in this tagged code.</p>

<p>In addition, from my glance the existing Alpha11 code does not seem to kill/restart sensor threads properly when the config changes.  The threads continue.  Before I went too much into the detail, I was wonder where I might find the implementation to support min refresh time, and try that.  I also would have thought having one thread per sensor, is very heavy on resources.  Maybe one thread to iterate through the sensors, another thread to monitor the sensor thread.</p>

<p>Last question, is there a url or way to stop/pause the sensors while controller is running, then resume.  I don't think there is - but as my mother said it's best to ask.  (Sometimes you don't know what you don't know).</p>

<p>Loving this project - learning more each day</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks Yann - Ill take a look.  I've just changed my local Alpha11 version to only use a single thread and iterate around the sensors - (rather than a thread per sensor).  The services I have do not block - I haven't implemented a monitor, or executer thread as I am just playing and learning.</p>

<p>I was having problems as I am trying to run controller under Karaf, and Karaf uses quite a few threads.  It was getting too much for my Alix board.  What I also did was slow down the sensor refresh if there is an error - right down to one http get per miniute.  As soon as a failed service resumes and went good, the sensor loop notices and resumes with the appropriate short delay.  I did this because Controller hammers the http services no matter if they are available or are off line. </p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer... everyone's work is sincerely appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit It does look like threads are not being stopped when you stop and restart a WAB - So I changed my local  code to terminated the thread when the context closes - this solves the rouge threads from continuing.</p></font>

Juha is currently doing some more work in that version and will release as final 2.0 soon.</p></font>
