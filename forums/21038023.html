				    <p>I have a TrickleStar wall plug and USB dongle (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/TrickleStar-300ZW-US-W-Z-Wave-USB-Stick/dp/B002NHLD2W">http://www.amazon.com/TrickleStar-300ZW-US-W-Z-Wave-USB-Stick/dp/B002NHLD2W</a>) for the Mac (OS X) but have to keep resetting the communication between the USB dongle and the plug because if I close the lid on my computer (as I invariably have to every day) the connection's severed and needs to be reset. TrickleStar released an API for their hardware (USB dongle) but I cannot program personally, which is a problem as I wanted to get it to work on a wireless router so I didn't' have to worry about such things.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a similar experience to me?</p>


<p>I saw a review of the open source software on Automated Home (<a href="http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/video/video-openremote-demos-application-integration-on-iphone-and-ipad.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AutomatedHome+%28Automated+Home%29">http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/video/video-openremote-demos-application-integration-on-iphone-and-ipad.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AutomatedHome+%28Automated+Home%29</a>) and was hoping I might be able to get the iOS part of the puzzle completed as I wanted to control the wall plug from my iOS device as well.</p>

<p>I remember looking at a router which specifically allowed for USB devices to be accessed over WiFi but it was mainly restricted to storage (apparently), it also being a driver issue.</p>
