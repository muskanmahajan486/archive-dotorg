                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>you are right! thanks for the advice, I got lost between my iPod and the AppStore.</p>

<p>For those who are as stupid as me, to update you need to go to the AppStore app on your iPod, then select "update" and you get the update. Easy enough.</p>

<p>Now I have got the update, it is strange I only see the "Steuern" and "Beobachten" tabs. No "Datenbank" nor "Info" tab. As soon as I touch a "Markisen"-entry it goes down, I touch again, it goes up (no up/down buttons appear as in the last version). Those buttons appear with the lights, but they do not work.</p>

<p>I have an iPod Touch 2nd generation with the newest 3.1.3 vesion installed. The previos OpenRemote installation worked with that (albeit with all the problems discussed).</p>

<p>Has anyone had the same experience? and what did you do?</p>

<p>Regards</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks again! </p>

<p>So Jörg is learning from Microsoft (never retain the menu structure of the version before, people might get used to it!).</p>

<p>The documentation does not reflect the new version except for the "changes" entries. Is there more documentation somewhere?</p>

<p>The blinds combi-object keeps crashing upon me though. And not showing the "oben"/"Unten" buttons seems to be intended as a feature; once it is up, any action can only be bringing it down, so why offer the button? It is annoying though, since when it is going down, you cannot just STOP it as with the real buttons at my wall. But maybe the Combi behaves different when it does not crash!</p>

<p>Creating a Combi-Object led several times to creating group 0/0/0 and only on the nth try did it create C001. </p>

<p>More after testing with the bus-monitor running in parallel.</p></font>
