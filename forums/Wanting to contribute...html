<p>Hi can I applaud this vision of this project.I work for Ivory Egg when run www.knxshop.co.uk &amp; www.enoceanshop.co.uk.<br/>
I would like to contribute to the KNX stream.I have developed an Ajax/Server Side JavaScript based control solution for both KNX &amp; EnOcean control technologies. Being a solutions architect I'm not the best coder around but I can TEST as I have plenty of KNX kit too.<br/>
When I click the KNXIntegrationProject link I get a <font color="#ff0000"><b>page not found&#33;&#33;</b></font>I would like to add EnOcean wireless system to the list of supported protocols in the integration stream.<br/>
I will look to involve the guy who has already developed a C interface for EnOCean and get it built into OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Thanks for your offer to help. Sorry about the broken link, as you can see there's still a lot left to do on the website. I've fixed it for now (the KNX integration project information was outdated).</p>

<p>Current plan for KNX support in the first releases is to have the ability to create UI elements that send a command to a KNX group address over an IP gateway. While the existing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/openremote">videos</a> don't really highlight it yet (I still need to wait couple of weeks to get my hands on an KNX test kit), you can see there's a KNX tab there where you will configure the KNX address + command.</p>

<p>I'm sure after the first milestones there will be more KNX to come. Let me know how that fits into what you're currently working on.</p>

<p>I would be happy to buy a Asus B202 configuered so I can use it with my KNX test rig along with my Iphone.&nbsp; However KNX over IP isn't cheap there some very affordable RS232 ascii based interfaces avaiable Tapko do one <a href="http://www.tapko.de/SIM-KNX.25.0.html?&amp;L=1">http://www.tapko.de/SIM-KNX.25.0.html?&amp;L=1</a> DIN/REG<br/>
mounted &amp; Arcus-eds.de for example.</p>
