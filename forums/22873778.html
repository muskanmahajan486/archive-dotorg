				    <p>Hello.</p>

<p>I sort of have a crude home automation setup going on using micro controllers to do mains switching, sensor detection AC control etc.<br/>
i am using an arduino mega with an Ethernet shield to create a small server(or base) of sorts. right now its a simple html page which has all the buttons etc.<br/>
at the end points i have atmega 328 micro controllers controlling and monitoring a specific room.<br/>
the base and the various micro controllers in the different rooms communicate over RF using nrf24l01+ transceiver.<br/>
i have this system working rather nicely. <br/>
However the web interface leaves alot to be desired. since the server is actually a micro controller with an ethernet shield, the web interface is restricted only to html and memory is also another issue. i would like to have a nice UI to control the setup.<br/>
so i figured i would try using a raspberry pi as the main server.<br/>
There is a library that will allow me to communicate with my already existing system using the GPIO pin connected to the transceiver.</p>

<p>I started was wondering if it would be possible to use Open remote on raspberry pi to control my existing setup.</p>

<p>what i want to know is, would it be possible to incorporate the commands from that library into open remote somehow ?</p>

<p>an obvious question would be, why use these modules instead of zigbee, z-wave or insteon. <br/>
the answer is rather simple, the total cost of this system is substantially lower and it works pretty much the same way.</p>

<p>the library can be found at <a href="https://github.com/stanleyseow/RF24/tree/master/librf24-rpi/librf24">https://github.com/stanleyseow/RF24/tree/master/librf24-rpi/librf24</a>.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>thank you for the reply juah.<br/>
The existing system is 2 way. It is mostly 1 way, and occasionally maybe ever 30sec or so the base node receives data from other nodes, on the status of switches and the temp, humidity, light levels etc.</p>


<p>allow me to explain a bit more in detail, maybe then you could suggest something better or tell me that i cant do it with my skill level.<br/>
the library has functions such as network.send() and network.read().<br/>
these functions are able to send/receive data to/from a node (which is a MC connected to things, Lights,Fan etc)  <br/>
i am using different struct to hold the values of each of the connected peripheral. so a struct for each of the rooms.<br/>
now, when ever the i click something on the page, it changes the relavant value in the struct and send the entire structure to the node.  <br/>
the node then process the information and does what needs to be done.</p>

<p>for instance</p>

<p>lets say that my ethernet+arduino is base node 00 .<br/>
lets say  Master bedroom is node 01.<br/>
I have web page, that lists various room and the attached peripherals.<br/>
something like this<br/>
Room 1</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Light (these are buttons)</li>
	<li>Fan<br/>
Room 2</li>
	<li>Light</li>
	<li>Fan</li>
</ul>


<p>now say i click the fan button on room1 , my arduino+ethernet (which is hosting the page) gets something like Room01,sw02,ON<br/>
now i extract the value of room ie 01 , the switch value 02, and the status ON ie 1.<br/>
i use the value of the room as the node to send the data to, and store the status of the switch in the relevant position in the struct.<br/>
so <br/>
room 1(this is the struct)</p>
<div class="error"><span class="error">Unknown macro: {
Light = 0
Fan = 1
}</span> </div>

<p>now i send this struct using the function network.send()<br/>
on the other end, i use network.read() to get the data<br/>
and the fan turns on.</p>

<p>this is just a simple example to illustrate what is going on .</p>

<p>now what i would want to happen is this.</p>

<p>I create an UI of the house in open remote.<br/>
i link the fan in master bedroom to be sw 02.<br/>
now when i click the button in the UI, it should identify that it is room01sw02ON . or something along those lines. (i believe this is how your software works already)<br/>
i just need it to send the data using network.send() . obviously, this would require that open remote recognizes the library.<br/>
and occasionally use the network.read() function to update values such as temp, humidity of each room.</p>

<p>now that you are better able to understand how my setup is working, what do you think ? will i be able to use open remote in a way that is not overly complicated a few newbie like me ?<br/>
i am willing to learn, if you could point me the right direction .</p></font>
