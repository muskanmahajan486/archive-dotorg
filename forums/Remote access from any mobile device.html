				    <p>To me it is not very clear the control of OR via remote access, I have read in the forums that currently is not possible to use OR through 3G connections, can someone explain to me how can I access to my panels from my smartphone when I am not in my wifi network?</p>

An alternative solution would be to use port forwarding and connecting to your external IP (you can use DynDNS service to tie it to some meaningful name). The disadvantage of this solution is that it is less secure than VPN because all your client server traffic goes unencrypted.</p></font>

If not, then this would indicate there is some issue with the connection itself. If this works, then OpenRemote Console might be the culprit.</p>

<p>Just to be sure, try it when directly connected to your LAN so you're sure the IP address and port numbers are correct.<br/>
When that works, connect through VPN and do the same test.</p></font>

<p>Do you mean that I must use the web console to access from my mobile device?</p>

<p>What I mean is that I want to control my devices at home from my smartphone or tablet (with the  mobile  application and not from a browser) from anywhere, such as a 3G environment or from a hotspot or wifi outside my home.</p>

<p>What I want to do is connect my smartphone to my server via the VPN connection so that when I am in an 3G environment can get a safe connection with my server at home.</p>

<p>I have my devices connected with Vera Lite and RFXCOM and work perfectly from the server of "micasaverde" from anywhere (Connection 3G, WIFI, Hotspots). Right now I am setting my server with the designer PRO, because according to the article attached in the link below remote access works only for PRO users.</p>

<p><a href="http://openremote.org/display/docs/Deploy+your+user+interface">http://openremote.org/display/docs/Deploy+your+user+interface</a></p>

<p>Do you know any solution that can be applied from the application itself and not from the console web console.</p>

<p>In fact, it would be very interesting to have an option within the application to connect to the VPN connecion and to wake this one up only when the application is called.</p></font>

<p>The iOS console will use HTTP REST calls to the controller, it's the way the communication works.<br/>
So I wanted you to use a web browser (Safari on your iPhone) to double check that HTTP calls can reach the controller.</p>

<p>THe Pro version remote access is a service that allows easy access from anywhere without the need to setup a VPN. Unfortunately, it's not ready for prime time yet.<br/>
If you have a VPN setup, you don't need that feature. Once a VPN connection is established, the controller should appear "as a local resource" to the console.</p></font>

<p>This is not the most effective solution, because most of the times the application fails to establish the connection immediately with the controller and can not find the panels, this is quite frustrating because sometimes you have to configure the external IP address again so you can establish the connection again.</p>

<p>I've been looking at possibilities to connect to the server through Websocket, but actually now do not have much time to go into this.</p>

<p>I believe that one of the priorities of home automation is the ability to manage things when you are not at home and to maintain constant communication with the environment that you are controlling or monitoring.</p></font>

<p>It is quite easy to use symbolic addresses tied to your home and updated dynamically. I'm doing this all the time and it works perfect both with (open)VPN and port forwarding. The procedure how to have a symbolic address linked to the external IP address is described in my blog <a href="http://mqlservice.net/openremote/2014/05/10/no-more-free-dyndns-time-for-ordns/">http://mqlservice.net/openremote/2014/05/10/no-more-free-dyndns-time-for-ordns/</a></p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Michal,</p>

<p>I had read your solution before and I find it interesting, this is a good alternative to the paid service from NO-IP which I use.</p>

<p>When I say:</p>

<p>"this is quite frustrating because sometimes you have to configure the external IP address again so you can establish the connection again"</p>

<p>I mean the configuration of the external IP address on the application itself, not on the controller.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I connect and disconnect the VPN service on the phone through Tasker, the app (openremote) loses completely the contact with the controller and there is no way on the app to force the connection to get refresh. To establish communication again I must to remove the IP address already configured and set it again to restore the connection with the VPN.</p>

<p>I've been tempted to experiment with moteino's and OR. On one of the tutorials from Moteino I found the solution which they use to control and read the status of the devices through a simple web Interface on the raspberry and from there, the idea to try to connect the server using websockets. <a href="http://lowpowerlab.com/blog/2013/10/11/raspberrypi-home-automation-gateway-hardware-and-demo/">(MOTEINO)</a></p>

<p>I'm learning RESTFUL and maybe later I can experiment on Android with the solution that Eric present for the iOS console using HTTP REST.</p></font>

<p>I mean that when I have full understanding of the management of REST API I would like to test the connection using the REST API on the Android console, I refer specifically to Android because on your previous comment you are referring specifically to the iOS console. So far I did not know that both consoles use the same REST API.</p>

<p>ERIC @ Aug 19, 2013<br/>
"The iOS console will use HTTP REST calls to the controller, it's the way the communication works.<br/>
So I wanted you to use a web browser (Safari on your iPhone) to double check that HTTP calls can reach the controller."</p></font>
