				    <p>I've been working on a new protocol for OpenRemote, as a few of you well know, and I'm now wondering about the inclusion process. I have my own openremote/workspace I just have to commit my changes to that after a tidy up.</p>

<p>Is there a review process and how long does it take? The only reason I'm asking is because I want to drop the equipment back to the owner, and let him use it. As I've been testing with my own local Designer webapp I've been able to design my Panel's but they can't be saved and reloaded locally. So every time I login to the local Designer my Building section has saved my design data but the UI Modeler just gives me an error message, I'll post it at the bottom of this message.</p>

<p>It seems like my local Designer is trying to load my previously designed panels from the openremote server out there in the Internet, instead of my local machine. Your admins might have gotten a few messages over the last few days. Sorry! </p>

<p>Ideally If my Local Designer would save and restore from the local machine and not the Internet I could just run a local copy of my Designer and Controller for my friend to test his equipment with, in his house. That way if further changes are required I could do them before any commit to official openremote. On the other hand if the inclusion process is not a biggy I could clean things up for inclusion over the next few days.</p>

<p>The ERROR Message:</p>

<p>There was an implementation error in Designer while restoring your account data. The system administrators have been notified of this issue. To prevent potential damage to your data, further modifications have been disabled until the admins have cleared the issue. Do not make changes to your designs or configuration during this period, as these changes may get lost. For further assistance, please contact support.

<p>My question relates to implementing this and Java threads. Looking over my code I've assumed that the Command when executed is in it's own Thread and that I can Sleep for the short duration. Can anybody confirm if this is the case and save me trying to work out going through the Java Code for the system?</p>
