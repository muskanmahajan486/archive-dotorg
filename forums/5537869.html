				    <p>  Firstly, thanks Jörg Falkenberg very much for help me investgating KNX in my non-work interesting with so much email.</p>

<p>  With my interesting.<br/>
  Currently, the communication with IP Interface n148/21 works well by default ip address of 192.168.0.10(Maybe configed by Jörg), but my PC ip address is 192.168.1.5. So, I must switch my pc ip to 192.168.0.20. Obviously, it's so inconvenience. I just want to config the ip of  IP Interface n148/21 to which I want.</p>

<p>  ETS is a very professional tool in personally.</p>

<p>  Any body can help me?</p>

But some people report problems when trying todo it that way. Another alternative would be to use a second bus access device (RS232, USB) to connect to the bus and program the IP interface. The most elegant way would be to have a DHCP server running within your network and have your PC and KNX IP-Interface receive the IP via DHCP.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>  Good.<br/>
  Thanks.</p>

<p>  However, I had tried to config ip address of Ip Interface with DHCP server(TP-Link Router in china): I could get the MAC address from the IP Interface device and configged the ip address in the DHCP server with MAC address, but it didn't work when I send ON/OFF singal to IP interface with ETS after configging and re-powering on the ip interface. Because ETS couldn't find the IP Interface either, with the ip address I configged.</p>

<p>  Sometimes, I thought if there was a wiki which can guide users, we can save much time.</p></font>

Normally this is done in the ets application of that device. You probably need a second bus access to program the IP-Interface. Maybe you can borrow a USB gateway somewhere?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>First you have to import the ets application for your IP-Interface into ets. If you go to the settings of the device you will probably see that you can either give the device a fixed IP or set it to use DHCP. If it is not configured for DHCP it will not send the DHCP request to your router. Now you have to use ets to program the device with the settings.</p>

<p>To program bus devices with ets you have two options: local or bus. Local is used to program the bus interface (RS232, USB, IP depending on your hardware) which is directly connected to the computer ('locally') and bus is used to program all other bus devices (actuator, sensor) which are only connected to the computer through the bus. If you cannot program your IP-Interface through the local setting (computer and ip-interface connected with a ethernat cable an configured for the same subnet) you need another bus device (eg. usb gateway). Then the computer will be connected with the usb device to the bus and the IP-Interface will be connected with the bus.</p>

<p>The USB gateway is just another way of accessing the bus. It has nothing todo with you ip interface.</p></font>

<p>sorry to read that it is still not working. I tried to reproduce your problems here with my gateway and found to my surprise that you are right <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Obviously it is not possible to program the gateway you are using to connect to the KNX installation itself via Ethernet. It seems that you are stuck with either that IP address or you manage to get an USB or RS-232 interface for KNX.</p></font>

<p>So happy to read your reply. I thought you were so busy, so I didn't bother you anymore and publish the issue on Openremote forums.</p>

<p>However, don't worry about this. Because currently it's not the key work in the priority job list, may be forever not. I just didn't want to give up this issue.</p>

<p>I got your words this time. Thank you all the same.</p>

<p>You know I am very happy to got your comment.</p>

<p>Thank u.</p></font>
