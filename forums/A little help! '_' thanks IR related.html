				    <p>Hi, this project is the neatest thing i've seen in a longgg while.. so i wanted to see if i can get it to work..<br/>
after bouncing across tons of posts and some documentation and stuff. <br/>
i've gathered that i need servlet server (tomcat) running controller. <br/>
and if i want IR i gotta be on linux to use lirc. since i just bought this commandIR thing .<br/>
and i have to build either for android or iphone or whatever console for 2.0 since its not released yet.<br/>
and design it using the designer... <br/>
here is my problem.. <br/>
1. <br/>
how do i control my shaw boxes or whatever else boxes with IR that is not in your beehive database to import ir commands?<br/>
is there a way to add things to the beehive so that i can do it?</p>

<p>2. also, i havent received my commandIR yet but when i do.. i assume i gotta be in linux. is there something i have to install for the box?<br/>
or something? or is lirc already there? is there something i have to do to configure it to work with OpenRemote?</p>

<p>Thanks alot for any help you can give.. </p>

<p>alphaz.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>1. If the LIRC community hasn't recorded your IR yet, you can do it yourself using their tools. You can either submit it to the LIRC project (we sync our database with their new submissions regularly) or you can post it here and I'll add it to the database.</p>

<p>2. You will need to install LIRC. At the moment it is Linux only (there's an older Windows version but the project seems to be quite stagnant). LIRC is rarely pre-installed in the default distributions but many distros offer a prepackaged versions that you can click to download and install using the usual package management tools. LIRC configuration may or may not be necessary depending whether the drivers for the IR transmitter of your choice (CommandIR) have already been compiled into the binaries by the Linux distributor you use. If not, you will need to go through the compile tools to get your drivers added. IIRC CommandIR has the instructions on their website.</p>

<p>Once the LIRC daemon is running/available on the PATH variable, OR will find it and use it. Just in case it cannot be found, you can configure an explicit path to LIRC for OR too.</p>

<p>Alternative is to bypass the whole software build/installation process altogether and buy an IP-to-IR hardware directly, such as IRTrans or GlobalCache. But since you already ordered CommandIR, sounds like you're happy to hack Linux and LIRC together to accomplish your goals <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>
