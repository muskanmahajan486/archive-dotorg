				    <p>Using an Android phone. I currently can only test a remote for controlling XBMC, as I have not received my itach IP2IR yet. I notice that button repeat performance is pretty poor. In other words, if I told down a direction arrow to scroll through a list of movies, the list responds sluggishly and in erratic fits and starts. When I do the same thing with the XBMC remote control app, holding down the arrow key results in fast, fluid scrolling through the list. </p>

<p>Why is the performance so different from the XBMC app, and can I expect similar performance with IR devices? I.e. when I hold down a volume up key for my receiver, will it respond in this sluggish, erratic fashion?</p>

<p>Also, (unrelated), when will the content-type property for HTTP be implemented in the designer? Having to manually add it to every command in the controller file after every change in the designer is quite tedious.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Actually I'm getting erratic performance in general. I just have direction and select keys set up, but sometimes I can't move through the list or select anything. If I hold down the key eventually it will usually activate. Shutting down and restarting XBMC does not help. Oddly, what does help is using the XBMC remote app for a moment; when I switch back to openremote, it works fine for awhile (although still with poor repeat performance).</p>

<p>I tried using Wireshark to compare what's being done between XBMC Remote app versus OpenRemote, but I'm in over my head here and don't know how to configure it properly. I can see the stuff from XBMC Remote &#8211; there's an initial http json request to request version etc on app startup, and after that everything is just a UDP with nothing I can read &#8211; but don't know where to look for the stuff OpenRemote controller is sending.</p></font>

<p>HTTP requests can be heavy to set up (build up and tear the connection between each request) compared to TCP connection or UDP packets. That might affect repeat performance. But as I said, I'm speculating I haven't tried XBMC yet.</p>

<p>From your description it sounds like the XBMC app might be using UDP packets to communicate, instead of HTTP.</p>
