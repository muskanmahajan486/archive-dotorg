				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm just adding this as it took me some time to solve.</p>

<p>I'm using port forwarding at home to point port 8080 to my internal machine that hosts OpenRemote (which by the way is a great app !)</p>

<p>It worked when I was internal to my network, but when connecting from outside, the app would come up with the "Loading..." message on the screen, then the app would close for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>After much messing around, I eventually found if I added the URL manually AND added the username and password, it worked perfectly, but if you leave out the username/password portions it seems to close the app with no messages indicating why.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
Andrew</p>
