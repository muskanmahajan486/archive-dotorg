				    <p>You might have hear about the ransomware that attacked a lot of Synology systems over the past week.<br/>
My system was not affected but I decided to upgrade the security. I have switched off the admin account for instance.<br/>
Now I found out that the pages of the controller, designer and console are completely blank.<br/>
I ahd a similar issue with Cronjob editor. The solution there was to change admin to the new username (in the configfiles of Cronjob).</p>

<p>For Openremote I can not find such a thing.</p>

<p>I have already installed new java. Running now Java SE embedded 8 1.8.0_6-0027. This was not the solution. Also with version 6 of Jave SE Embedded no luck.<br/>
Re-installed php my admin. All is working.</p>

<p>Open remote is running as normal. I can use it on my iPhone without a problem.<br/>
Ideas are welcome.</p>
