				    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>after a long (very long) time not touching anything I was trying to get some things done new. I updated the controller (Ubuntu -&gt; works), I synced the designer (works) and firstly started the webconsole (because I wanted to be sure everything works to get webconsole running on my lumia 930 windows phone).<br/>
webconsole starts, offers the controller, but trying to get my room selection page up I get the error message "Console error: Failed to build screen definition Additional Info: Screen ID = 55".<br/>
trying to get the webconsole running on my windows phone stucks by adding the controller. I get an empty page not being able to add the controller - so I have to choice to test...</p>

<p>I could not find anything about the message, so any ideas here?</p>

<p>thanks for your help!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Achim,</p>

<p>I had the same error.<br/>
I then looked at the panel.xml file and at the screen, which failed to build. It turned out to be an incorrect grid definition. <br/>
In my particular case it was a grid, where I reduced the number of rows. But in one of the rows there was still a label in the rows, which were not part of the reduced grid anymore. I expanded the grid again and deleted the label. After that the screen was fine.</p>

<p>So it may be worth while to look at the  screen definition in your panel.xml file to see whether there is something in there that is at fault.</p>

<p>Best wishes</p>
