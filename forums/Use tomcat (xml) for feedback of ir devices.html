				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>i`ve some devices without feedback, which means that this are FS20 actors and ir-devices whithout distinctive ON/OFF commands.<br/>
In another thread i`ve opened some weeks ago the solution was to use in-memory-commands to use this devices with switches.</p>

<p>Now i am thinking to use the tomcat server to host a xml file which holds all the current states of my devices (meantioned above).<br/>
This xml file then could be read from the OR sensors and could be manipulated via the shell execution protocol.</p>

<p>This would have a huge advantage for me and eventually for other users too:</p>

<p>I could use my harmony remote to control devices which would result in turning them on or off and then write the value to the xml file so that OR recognizes it.<br/>
Using OR is great but when the tablet runs out of battery it would be great to control devices without crashing everything.</p>


<p>So, is there any solution already covering the scenario?</p>

<p>Another question is: Does anybody know if it is possible to let a Global Cache device act as a receiver on one of its "inputs" so that i can react on harmony remote button pushes?</p>

<p>Thank You</p>

<p>Johannes</p>

<p>I don't think there's any consensus solution to this, it sounds like an ad hoc integration that if it has been done before has been done for specific installation requirements only. So your XML approach seems fine. </p>

Not sure what you mean when you say "hardware-ir-receiver".</p>

<p>LIRC can be installed on a linux machine and supports connection to many IR receivers.</p>

<p>In the context of OR, there is a UDP Listener protocol that can be used in conjunction with an IRTrans so that OR does react to IR commands sent from a regular IR remote.</p></font>

<p>Hi, the Documentation in german can be found here: <a href="http://www.hildenbrand-nbg.de/?p=340">http://www.hildenbrand-nbg.de/?p=340</a>, i`ll look when i have time to translate it.<br/>
It could be linked to the page you mentioned but i don`t know if it is interesting for people who install OR on their qnap (Once QNAP is Off, OR is off too <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> )</p>

<p>@ ERIC<br/>
I will have a look at the irTrans devices. Advantage would be that you have a very small device without a big power consumption. The big disadvanage is that you still have to deal with the in memory sensors for every without-state-ir-device.</p>

<p>Don`t know if the xml solution wouldn`t be more "compatible" and easier for OR-starters, not to mention the price (lirc vs. irtrans) ?</p></font>
