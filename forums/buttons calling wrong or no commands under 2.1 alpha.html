				    <p>After helpful advice in another thread, I've upgraded my controller (running on Raspberry Pi) to 2.1 alpha so I could get my ShellExe sensors working.</p>

<p>The sensors are indeed working fine now, but it seems to have broken something that was fine before. I have three pairs of on/off commands, each linked to a button, that run one shell script with a unique parameter to turn on/off three different LightWaveRF power sockets. The shell script logs each call so I can see when it was called and what parameter was passed to it. After the upgrade, the buttons no longer all switch on/off the correct devices. Some don't call the script at all now, and some call it but with the wrong parameter. This is not reflected in the UI designer though - this still shows each button calling the correct command.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the controller.xml file looks OK too. It's a shame the UI designer doesn't show the unique ID for each button, as that would make it easier to work out where things are going wrong.</p>

<p>I've kept my old 2.0.1 controller install, so I swapped back to that and synced. All the on / off switches worked as they should again (but not the sensors - seems like I can have one or the other but not both!), so it definitely looks like an issue with 2.1 alpha.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest how I can try to debug further what is happening?</p>

<p>After testing it out on 2.0.1 I've switched back to 2.1 and synced again. That seems to have fixed it. </p>

<p>I'd be interested to know why the linkage was so screwed up the first time, but I guess I'll never know now!</p></font>
