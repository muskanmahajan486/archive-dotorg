				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am using (or better: trying to use) OpenRemote KNX 1.4 which I purchased recently from the itunes store on an ipod touch 3G 32GB. Basically let me explress my regards for the application so far, I really appreciate the approach to have a control software without the need of a server running.</p>

<p>Acutally, I cannot use the software in the way I wanted it because of some restriction (or am I perhaps too stupid to get it working properly - it could be either of both).</p>

<p>I am using the german language version, so I have to use the german expressions ... I will try to add some english translations in brackets.</p>

<p>What I want at first is just to control some rooms for which I am used to using "Lichtszenen" (Light szenes). For instance I have a sczene at 1/3/0 with:<br/>
"0" - all off<br/>
"1" - all on<br/>
"2" - Party light<br/>
"3" - TV<br/>
etc.</p>

<p>, so I want to send a 8 bit value to the Group Adress. How can I do this?</p>

<p>As a second chance, I installed some logik, so if I send a "1" (1Bit) onto Group Adress 1/7/0, my logik will send the 8bit "0" onto 1/3/0 - this is to start scenes by 1 bit command (this is beeing done by Linknx), but even if I parameter the 1/7/0 in Gruppe bearbeiten (edit group), as lesbar (readable) = 0 and Typ (type) = "1 setzen" (set 1), it will always send a "1" and afterwards a "0" onto the Group Address, so I will always have to push the button twice to start the sczene. Am I doing something wrong, or is this a bug?</p>

<p>What I don't understand in the "Guppen" (groups) setting menu, there is the possibility to say that groups are "abh√§ngig von" (dependant on) - perhaps you could explain this to me? Is there a documentation which I couldn't find?</p>

<p>In addition, I didn't get the very meaning of "Kombiobjekt" (combined object) - and I didn't find any documentation for this. What is the meaning of it?</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Stefan</p>

<p>Regarding scenes, I tried out the Lite version and was not able to use a Scene Value (DPT_Scene), at least not to send a specific Value. I was able to get Switching and Dimming to work. One "McGyver" way to do it would be to call Scenes using a Switch (DPT_Switch) instead. So, basically when you send a, "1," or a, "0" on the Bus. It's an older way of calling Scenes but you can then add a "Switched Light," and control the scenes that way. A bit tedious when you've already got the Scenes set up using DPT_Scene in your Bus Devices, but doable.</p>


<p>As far as the Logic is concerned, I'm not sure I follow what you've written. You're using Linknx for the Lightscenes or the Logic, or both?</p>

<p>Using Logic would be a way around it, as you say, and I was able to do a similar thing with some existing Lightscenes in our Office here. My concern, from a KNX-perspective, would be that you're using a lot of "Homemade" solutions ... while I've come across Linknx before, he states on his website that he's using a "Homemade" FT1.2 Interface. Are you using this same device? If so, that could be part of the reason ... there's a reason why KNX products are tested for Certification-purposes. (I've seen some funny things in my 4&#43; years of working with it) Not even the major Manufacturers get it right with things all the time.</p>


<p>The other stuff, I'm not sure myself. Someone more knowledgable about the product would be able to help there. But, if you could give more of an idea as to your setup, that would go a long way to helping troubleshoot this.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Jean Pierre,</p>

<p>thank you for relying (I almost gave up <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> ). Now what you described by activation of the scenes via 1bit and then transfering them to an 8bit command is exactly what I do as a workaround. As a matter of fact, I am using a B&amp;J Roompanel for this. This is the device where my light scenes are stored and activated. I have some additional scenes in one Gira TS2+</p>

<p>But even though I am using this logik, I still have the problem that Openremote KNX always wants to toggle the group address, so if I push the button on my Ipod touch for sending a 1bit command it sends the opposite value the next time (so everytime I push the button, an alternating 1 and 0 are sent). So I could have my logik to react on 1 and 0 onto this group address, but this would mean I'd need many more logik commands ...</p>

<p>Concerning your question about "homemade" logik, I am using a B&amp;J Roompanel, a Siemens Logo!, a Suntracer KNX and an ASUS WL500gP with openWRT 8.09 with eibd and linknx. The interface to the knx world is a IP router (eibmarkt - Weinzierl 750). So the only thing which is not certified is the ASUS router, but it is only beeing take as an addition (and of cause OPENREMOTE KNX).</p>

<p>I hope this helps to clearify the situation and any help is welcome.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Stefan</p></font>

<p>Cool ... ok, glad to hear it's not a homemade interface. I'm looking at how to do that, anyway, but I do realize that there may be issues. (Arduino + TPUART chip ... it'll be a while before I can really dedicate time to it since we're opening up a Training Center <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I'm not so familiar with the Busch-Jaeger Roompanel. I'm guessing it's not the new version, but that the logic is either in the Roompanel or the Logo&#33;. Probably the Logo. That's good, cuz there's so much that you can do with that thing ...</p>


<p>I have taken a look and don't see anywhere in the Raumpanel or 2-plus to add a 1-bit Group Object to call a scene with. It's a shame, really, as the SmartSensor and GIRA InfoTerminal Touch both have it and it might have been a way out of this, as well.</p>

<p>So either way it sounds like you're going to have to double up on the logic as it sounds like they've programmed a sort of Toggling Push Button instead of discrete On/Off buttons. (I'm sorry, but I don't have an iPod and my boss has his with him elsewhere at the moment)</p>

<p>So, unless they update the software to give discrete On/Off commands on the Bus, you're pooched. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Juha, maybe this is something you guys can look into for an updated release?</p>

<p>Sorry I can't help much further than that. Lemme know if you need anything else.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Dear Jean-Pierre,</p>

<p>actually it is the BJ Roompanel doing the job to convert 1bit scenes into an 8bit scene command. The problem with the Logo! is that it is dremendously lacking in analogue in- and outputs (so they are already used for the automatic blinds).</p>

<p>OK - when I bought the software, I knew it was some kind of under development (I didn't know that there is still so much to do) and as I am not a professional programmer, I can only contribute into the project by giving a feedback from what I as a user would expect the software to do.</p>

<p>I think and hope that adding the possibility to send specified values (either 1/0 or 0-255) would be worth to be taken into concideration for one of the following updates.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Stefan</p></font>

<p>I'm right there with you as far as the extra features I'd love to see. From a usability standpoint, I'd say the thing is definitely a Beta product as far as features but, that said, I think it's outstanding what they've been able to do ... especially since I know other KNX Members who were/are dragging their feet with regards to the iPhone. That and, frankly, I'd not be able to do what was done in this amount of time. So, kudos to the team here for putting this together as it stands.</p>

<p>I do agree, however, that Discrete On/Off buttons and support for DPT_Scene is necessary to make this a v1.0 product for me.</p>

<p>Let's hope this is added soon&#33;</p>

<p>as I mentioned in the introduction, I really appreciate the approach for a native KNX access by Iphone / IPod Touch.</p>

<p>I had a look onto the changelogs and now I think that the problem with discrete ON/Off buttons is a bug, as this type of action is now implemented in 1.4 version. I hope that the developement guys read this (Juha?).</p>

<p>DPT_Switch and DPT_Scene handling... will keep those in priority list.</p>

<p>On the "serverless" approach to control, we are looking to expand this functionality with other IP based protocols from a single iPhone Console app (so means KNX but also other IP protocols from single UI, button and macros).</p>

<p>thanks for your reply (better late than never <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> and I can understand that the development has its own priority).</p>

<p>I've been thinking some time on the question how I could make my contribution to the project (apart from the installation fee for the app). As my programming experiences won't be much help (you wouldn't really need a LabView, Matlab or Delphi programmer ...), I could imagine to help you with documentation.</p>

<p>As you can see in my first statement, there are still some open questions regarding the dependancies of group object or the question what combined objects are. So if you want me to help you with this, please contact me (I would be available from end of August).</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Documentation help would be fine, basically it involves producing pages on this Wiki... so as soon as you're ready to start I can point you to suitable location.</p>

<p>And you clearly have good knowledge of KNX and have system to test with, so that will be valuable as well!</p>
