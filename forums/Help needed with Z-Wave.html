				    <p>Need help with Z-Wave.</p>

<p>I've been using Openremote for a couple of years now mainly with a Russound audio system, Sonos, and Satellite Radio setup.  I've always been able to solve my issues with the use of this forum or the documentation.  Unfortunately I've come across an issue trying to get zwave working that I haven't been able to solve, so I'm looking for some help.</p>

<p>I'm running the 2.1.0 controller on a Mac Mini running OS X 10.6.8.  For a zwave controller I'm using an Aeon Labs Z-stick 2. I'm trying to control a Leviton Vizia RF dimmer.  I've set up inclusion and exclusion switch and sensors which seems to be working except it fails to initialize the node.  The error I'm seeing is:</p>

<p>DEBUG 2015-12-27 10:40:40,993 (Z-Wave): RX_Session_Layer            : 'Application Controller Update' frame [Status: UPDATE_STATE_NODE_INFO_RECEIVED, Node ID: 4, Device Classes: <span class="error">&#91;Basic: BASIC_TYPE_ROUTING_SLAVE, Generic: GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL, Specific: SPECIFIC_TYPE_SCENE_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL&#93;</span>, Command Classes: [Supported: <span class="error">&#91;COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_MULTILEVEL, COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_ALL, COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTIVATION, COMMAND_CLASS_SCENE_ACTUATOR_CONF, COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION, COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC, COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION, COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_PROPRIETARY, COMMAND_CLASS_NODE_NAMING, COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL&#93;</span>, Controlled: COMMAND\_CLASS\_HAIL]] has been received.<br/>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I don't have an answer but the Leviton Vizia has more than one product line. The older one doesn't send status info.. it must be polled. These are found on the shelves of Home Depot, etc. Online, you can get one that seems labeled identically, same little stickers, but are of the slightly more modern Zwave spec that includes status changes being send to the controller(s). I'm going from memory here but I think it's the "VRS" series that auto-status.</p>

<p>I've read elsewhere that 1) the older ones send a "something happened" message but then the controller has to poll to find out what. 2) Leviton sells a "tool" to change the parameters on the older ones to auto-status. Neither of these can I confirm. </p>

<p>I did get one at Homedepot because it said it was a Scene Controller. Nothing. Worked exactly like an ordinary (non-scene) device. I got the VRS (if I remember right) from Amazon and it worked exactly as expected. I push it and I trigger a scene.</p>

<p>I doubt this helps, but I'm going to be very happy to be wrong! </p></font>
