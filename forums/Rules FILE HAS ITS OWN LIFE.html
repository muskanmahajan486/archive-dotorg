				    <p>My rules are vanishing / unchanging.<br/>
After writing a basic rule (to test my basic skills) in the rules editor of the Designer. I press the submit button and then the save button.<br/>
I am going to the controller directory and see a 0 bytes rules file as if no rules were written.<br/>
I even tried copying the rules file directly from my PC to the controller PC (a different one).<br/>
After a few times, the file agreed to appear in the rules section of the designer. Any thing I do is being ignored and the file with the bug remains as is.<br/>
Once I press the fix the and update the project (localhost:8080/controller), the file returns to its previous state (bug).</p>

<p>Is the a bug here?</p>

<p>Need help.</p>
