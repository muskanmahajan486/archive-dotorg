				    <p>First, I just wanted to say how much I've enjoyed using Openremote since I first stumbled upon it. Thank you to all the hard work that has been put into it.<br/>
(I also apologize ahead of time for the length of this post.)</p>

<p>Second, I just wanted to post a few things about my experience with using Openremote so far.<br/>
(There is absolutely NO intention to offend anyone with this. Just throwing my own two cents into the mix.)</p>


<p>Possible additions to a "Newbie" FAQ:<br/>
------------------------------------------<br/>
(Things that would have helped me anyway... If these exist elsewhere, I did not find them.)</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>How do you access/get to the setup/server connection screen when using a iPad?</li>
</ul>


<p>        Program in a settings button that links to the Navigation -&gt; Action -&gt; Settings.<br/>
        I had things working on the iPad for a while with no way to get to the Settings/<br/>
        Server screen. On an Android tablet it was easy. On the iPad is was not as obvious.</p>

<p>        I have to admit, this took me longer to figure out than it should have.</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>How do you put one image on top of another without losing the first image?</li>
</ul>


<p>        Use a background image as your base. You can then add an image on top of that.</p>

<p>        When I first started, I would upload a picture (a remote control) and then try to add<br/>
        a  button over it. As soon as you click off of the button, it causes your first picture<br/>
        to be moved to the foreground... causing your second picture to "disappear".</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>How do you replace a graphics image once you've uploaded it?</li>
</ul>


<p>        You can replace it on/within your local controller -&gt; webapps/controller/*.png<br/>
        I had created a small tranparent .png to use as the background for a button.<br/>
        I had messed it up slightly by not making the entire image transparent (I did<br/>
        not notice this at first). I wanted to replace that image without changing its<br/>
        name - and not having to update a bunch of buttons that were using it.</p>

<p>        Is there a better answer to this?</p>


<p>My Wishlist:<br/>
-------------<br/>
(I know I'm not the first to come up with these but thought I'd throw it out there anyway.)</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>A trial version of the professional software?</li>
</ul>


<p>        I'd love to try it out to see how much better it is than the free online designer,<br/>
        but not at $150. I'm not trying to use the product for professional purposes but would<br/>
        love a bit more control over the designer. It would be nice to be able to try before<br/>
        you buy. It may turn out that the free online designer is more than enough... I'd<br/>
        just love to be able to find out for myself.</p>

<p>        Perhaps a few screen shots to see what it looks like?</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The ability to copy screens between groups/panels.</li>
</ul>


<p>        I know this has been stated before.</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The ability to copy commands Between Devices.</li>
</ul>


<p>        Example: I have two Tivo's and two LG Blu-Ray players that are sitting on different<br/>
        Global Cache IR2PC boxes. Each box has a different IP but the IR commands are the<br/>
        same. It's a pain to have to create two sets of Devices with the same IR commands,<br/>
        just to change the location they are going to (i.e. 2 different IP's).</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Better resolution Android graphics. The current resolution is poor in comparison to the iPad.</li>
</ul>


<p>        I know this is being worked on.</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The ability to edit a set of commands imported via a template.</li>
</ul>


<p>        Example: I imported Tivo IR commands but could not use them because there was no way<br/>
        to edit how they were sent to a device (i.e. IR commands via a Global Cache IR2PC).<br/>
        Perhaps I did something wrong?</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Access to information on the hardware controller that is available? I do realize that it is<br/>
  a new product... just looking for more info.</li>
</ul>


<p>        Can anyone buy one?<br/>
        At what cost?<br/>
        Where do you buy it?<br/>
        Specs?</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>More info / Better access to the Beehive info.</li>
</ul>


<p>        I'm guessing that a lot of people "re-invent the wheel" over and over again when it<br/>
        comes to remote ir codes etc. It would be nice to have a better way to lookup/obtain<br/>
        this info. (Perhaps I just don't understand the existing method?)</p>



<p>Finally:<br/>
-------</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Thanks to everyone who's put this together. You've managed to make it my latest obsession!</li>
</ul>
