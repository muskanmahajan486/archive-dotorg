				    <p>has anyone gotten this working?</p>

<p>I was able to get it working after signing a APK as a BAR (blackberry file) and was able to get a working GUI. however after a few days, it stopped syncing to my controller. therefore, the old GUI is still here but does not update to any new changes i made on designer.</p>

<p>I uninstalled openremote app from the playbook and reinstalled it. but it does not save the URL that I have entered (192.168.1.##:8080/controller). It also does not auto discover. I reenter them every time and select the panel of choice. then tab DONE. However, I get a blank screen.</p>

<p>I exit the program and upon reloading the app, i have to reenter everything again.</p>

<p>I proceeded with jailbreaking the device and got android market on it. searched for openremote, download, install, open.</p>

<p>does anyone know what might be causing the blank screen issue (i have checked the resolution 1024x600 and it used to work).</p>

<p>here is the file to the openremote 2.0 BAR for playbook.
