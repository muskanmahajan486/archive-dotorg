				    <p>I found this post <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Sony+TV+HTTP+control">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Sony+TV+HTTP+control</a><br/>
However it did not work for me, my TV Requires authentication using a 'auth cookie'.</p>

<p>So to get around this, i have found a project on git which allows you to execute commands to your tv via your computer. Credit to (<a href="https://blog.yrden.de/2014/11/14/remote-control-bravia-tvs-with-authentication.html">https://blog.yrden.de/2014/11/14/remote-control-bravia-tvs-with-authentication.html</a>)</p>

<p>Essentially you need to run this on your linux or mac machine which is running the open remote controller, ill outline the steps below.</p>

<p>In your Terminal, move to the root of your user directory, i.e. cd /Users/JohnSmith<br/>
Then execute<br/>
git clone <a href="https://github.com/breunigs/bravia-auth-and-remote">https://github.com/breunigs/bravia-auth-and-remote</a><br/>
rename the folder that is created to 'bravia-ipctrl'</p>

<p>Then move into that directory, then edit the file auth.sh<br/>
You need to add your TV's IP into the script, also you should add a nickname for the controller. (Im doing this from memory, i think there are 2 fields where you have to change the name.)<br/>
Then save and quit.<br/>
You then will need to make the file auth.sh executable, run the command<br/>
sudo chmod +x auth.sh<br/>
Then execute ./auth.sh to execute the script.<br/>
The script will then register your computer with your TV, you will have to enter the PIN that is displayed on the TV into the script.<br/>
Once thats complete, you can look inside the file auth_cookie. This is your authentication key which registers you with the TV.<br/>
Next thing to do is to run the file print_ircc_codes.sh you might have to make it executable like before (sudo chmod +x print_ircc_codes.sh)</p>

<p>This will then print out all of the commands that will work with your TV. For reference it will be useful to copy and paste this into a word doc, you will need them later.<br/>
Now you have a list of commands that will work on the TV, your computer is also registered, its worth testing that this side of things actually works...</p>

<p>To do this make the file send_command.sh executable (sudo chmod +x send_command.sh)<br/>
Then execute (replace 192.168.0.0 AAAAAgAAABoAAAB8Aw== with your TV IP, and replace with the actual command code you want.<br/>
./send_command.sh 192.168.0.0 AAAAAgAAABoAAAB8Aw==</p>

<p>With a bit of luck your tv will do the command you sent <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> In this instance it should open Netflix.</p>



<p>So now that is done, you can now move to making open remote use this, its a really simple process but will have to be repeated for each command you might want to send.</p>

<p>In open remote, create a new device, then add a New Command, this command should be a shell execution protocol.</p>

<p>Set the path to: /Users/JohnSmith/bravia-ipctrl/send_command.sh</p>

<p>Then set the command protocol to (replace 192.168.0.0 with your tv IP and replace AAAAAgAAABoAAAB8Aw== with the command you want to send):<br/>
 192.168.0.0 AAAAAgAAABoAAAB8Aw==</p>

<p>And voila! That should work well <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Also i use the WOL command to switch on the TV.</p>
