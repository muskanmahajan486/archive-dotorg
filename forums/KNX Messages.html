				    <p>Hi!</p>

<p>I am developing .NET driver for KNXnet/IP, based on EN 13321-2.<br/>
Main goal is to create library that will simplify KNX integration.<br/>
Thing that made me start this is Falcon driver. Is one of the worst organized libraries I have ever seen,<br/>
not to mention that there is no any valuable documentation or tutorial.<br/>
Everything is working perfectly on IP level, but I would be very grateful if someone could clarify lower levels.<br/>
Since I can't afford to buy KNX Specification book (cca 1000 Eur), 'cEMI' is a riddle to me.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:<br/>
1. Searching the Internet I have found out that cEMI is not the same for every communication type and layer.<br/>
   90% of all software has L_Data cEMI implemented and I have done the same, but this cEMI type cannot be used<br/>
   for L_Busmon type and any message type constants starting with 'M_' !? <br/>
   Everybody are talking about layers and how cEMI structure depends on them.<br/>
   Can anyone explain this layering and how many there are?<br/>
   What are all cEMI formats for specific layer?<br/>
   L_Data cEMI is 'Data Link Layer' message, but it has APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) which is application layer payload!?</p>

<p>2. Can APDU in L_Data cEMI hold more than one Data Point Type?<br/>
   Can it hold more than one DPT in any format?</p>

<p>3. If DPT is less or equal to 6 bits, it can be encoded in the last 6 bits of APDU.<br/>
   I have found a way how to check if DPT is encoded in APDU, but I am not sure that this is the right way.<br/>
   Is there a way to know for sure if there is data in APDU?</p>

<p>4. How do I know what type of data is being sent in cEMI?</p>

<p>5. CRI structure in CONNECT_REQUEST frame for tunnel connection requires two additional bytes at the end.<br/>
   For now I know that I have to put 0x02 and 0x00 to be able to establish (Link layer|Data link layer|Application layer) messages.<br/>
   What are the other values I can use?</p>

<p>6. CRD in CONNECT_RESPONSE contains some additional values at the end.<br/>
   Can someone explain what are these for?</p>

<p>I think that is all for now <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
