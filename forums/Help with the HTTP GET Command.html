				    <p>Thanks in advance for any help.  I am trying to receive a command from one system (that is sending an HTTP Json command) via the HTTP GET command and then from that send a command to another device via HTTP POST.  I don't know what needs to go into the URL as well as what other information I need.  The only example I saw was for the weather but was not really relating to my issue.  Can someone please help?</p>

				    
                                            <div class="tabletitle">
                            <a name="comments">Comments:</a>
                        </div>

                        <table border="0" width="100%">
                                                        <tr>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Not unless you provide more information...</p>

<p>The basics would be:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>have the first HTTP GET command linked to a sensor to extract the value you want</li>
	<li>have a rule triggered based on that and in the rule trigger your HTTP POST command</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm not sure how to pass the sensor value to the second command though, would need some testing / looking at the source code.<br/>
I suppose if it's a post that the sensor value must somehow be part of the payload of the POST command.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks Eric for the response!</p>

<p>I think I get that part of extracting the command and then working with a sensor to pass to the other command.  My problem is, I don't know which URL (or how to write the URL) for the GET command.  I also don't know what other information needs to be in the GET command for the other fields if any.  For instance, I have a control system that is not able to send JSON commands to an XBMC system, I believe because it does not have a field for content-type. So I want to send a specific command from the control system that OpenRemote receives and then sends the appropriate JSON command to the XBMC system.  </p>

<p>I think there are two ways someone could help.  If someone could send me the correct header for a JSON command going to XBMC frodo as if you were just to type it rather than put it in the OpenRemote form.  OR give some advice on what I would need in the fields of the OpenRemote form to receive a specified IP command.  I hope this explained it a little better...</p></font>
