				    <p>Hi!</p>

<p>I have problems with this combination.<br/>
I was using OR KNX with l2tp VPN before without problems, now the router was changed to a cisco with IPSec.<br/>
VPN Connection from iPhone is working, i can access all network devices (fileserver, dreambox, router) but OR KNX is not connecting.<br/>
I tried a different app (aymonitorknx) and it's working through the IPSec tunnel.<br/>
Also notebook with cisco vpn client with ETS is working.<br/>
So i don't think its a problem with the VPN, the LAN or the KNX/IP Router.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what the problem could be?</p>

<p>Thanks<br/>
Stefan</p>
