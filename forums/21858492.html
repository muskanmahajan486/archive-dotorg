				    <p>Dear OpenRemote forum</p>

<p>I am newbie on OpenRemote (with a solid technical background) and just managed to get my first couple of lights to work with Openremote.<br/>
Controller: Synology DS211+<br/>
Protocol: Z-Wave via Aeon Z-Stick Series 2<br/>
Z-Wave devices: Several from Fibaro and Aeon Labs</p>

<p>As probably many other users I encountered several issues and have many questions for which I have not yet found the answers in the extensive documentation and forum. Hopefully some people could point me to the right places.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Is there a newbie-guide page where some of the points below could be answered? I might not be the only one <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></li>
	<li>Is there location where people can check and report (community) tested z-wave devices. Or maybe a complete configuration?</li>
	<li>Where to check for known issues and possibly report bugs? Here? <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Design+Forum">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Design+Forum</a></li>
	<li>General technical (zwave) questions.<br/>
  My most urgent question at this moment is how to support a zwave device with more switch inputs? (TKB Home: TKB TZ66-D <a href="http://www.tkbhome.com/?cn-p-d-111.html">http://www.tkbhome.com/?cn-p-d-111.html</a>)</li>
	<li>What about suggestions on OpenRemote documentation; typo's or not clear at some point? Just add a comment to that page?</li>
</ol>


<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Yes, please do it here (or in the comments section of the relevant wiki page). We'd be interested to know.</p>

<p>Best to start here so any report can be qualified first &#8211; later if it looks like you do a good job of qualifying issues yourself, can also do it directly into issue tracker. <a href="http://jira.openremote.org">Issue tracker</a> is also where to find existing known issues and tasks.</p>

<p>Will have to leave that to developers who have access to Z-wave source (unfortunately the terms do not allow us to release it in the open)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>If you think something is <a href="http://openremote.org/display/docs/Frequently+Asked+Questions">FAQ worthy</a>, please suggest the question and answer here.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

If you want to do more than binary switches and dimmers, and you want to finish your installation in the next half year or so, I would go for the Micasaverde Vera. Certainly if you are determined to use Z-Wave. I have seen a number of users here who have connected their Vera to OpenRemote. Besides I hear that Marcus is working on a better integration of Vera with OR.<br/>

<p>I would also be very interested in the direction you are looking for to support this (maybe less "easily"). Can you share some idea's? If so we should post it in a different topic.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
