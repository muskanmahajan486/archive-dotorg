				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm currently a windows user and have no idea about Linux but I can see I'm going to need to learn something soon.</p>

<p>I have some Windows PC's that are running 24/7 but I'm looking at switching these off soon and possibly moving to a separate NAS box ie a Synology. I ahev just bought I Raspberry Pi to try and get my panStamp gear operational.</p>

<p>I'm currently have another HA solution (Misterhouse) and this has around 30 inputs and 30 outputs of various types of I/O (1wire, Video Overlay, RFID, X10, X10RF) and also does Text to Speech etc.</p>

<p>So the question is - What is a good hardware platform to use the OpenRemote on (with out excessive overkill)? <br/>
Would a Raspberry Pi handle this?<br/>
Would a Synology NAS box be better?<br/>
Or should I just stick with a windows box?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Neil.</p>

Something Intel Atom based is usually sufficient to run OR so if you have PC boxes running, I'd start with that. Once the system is running like you want, you can always later transfer the controller setup to a smaller system like RPi or Synology &#8211; the latter two always require a few extra steps to get things running so you might want to eliminate too many moving parts if you're just getting started.</p>
