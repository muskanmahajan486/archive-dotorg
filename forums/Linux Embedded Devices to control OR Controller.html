				    <p>I've been looking for a while for a better option to replace my Raspberry Pi and within everything I 've looked I've only found one product that really get my attention and deserves to be mentioned here due to its good balance between price and capabilities.</p>

<p>The device that I have found is the CuBox-i, this mini computer seems to be the best option to the Raspberry Pi. Within the four options presented by SolidRun the best choice for my is the model CuBox-i2Ultra.</p>

<p>I find interesting that for the normal price (U.S. $104.99) this product promises to me to be a media center and a (OR controller) at the same time within a certain price range.</p>

<p>See the (CuBox-i) comparison tables <a href="http://cubox-i.com/table/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've not really had many problems with the Raspberry Pi but now I want to experiment something new and that actually offers me more possibilities and better performance with my OR controller.</p>

<p>I have two general questions:</p>

<p>1 -<br/>
Which is the best option to run OpenRemote on Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora or Debian), because I 've found some aspects on the OpenRemote forums that make me think that OpenRemote on Linux is something complicated. </p>

<p>2 -<br/>
Does anyone have any better suggestions to run OpenRemote on other mini computer which is in a price range of €70 to €100? (other than Raspberry Pi)</p>

<p>Attached to this are some links with useful information about the CuBox-i.</p>

the CuBox-i2 sounds already really promising unless you need eSata.</p>

<p>1) Which aspects regarding Linux did you find? <br/>
We use Linux on our eBox reference hardware, on RaspberryPi and our cloud service all run on Linux.</p>

<p>2) The CuBox indeed sounds really promising. Some community members are looking at beagleboard also: <a href="http://beagleboard.org/">http://beagleboard.org/</a><br/>
I don't have any information regarding performance though.</p></font>

<p>1)<br/>
I personally have not had any problems with my Linux (Debian), I have found that some users have had some observations, for example this: (<a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Linux+install+instructions">forum</a>). Anyway, the best way to know is experimenting it by myself.</p>

<p>2)<br/>
You say that the model CUbox-i2 is already good to run the controller in a smooth way, do you mean that purchase the model CUbox-i2Ultra  would be unnecessary?<br/>
Or do you think that if I want to run the controller and XBMC at the same time would be better with the Ultra model?</p>

<p>Could you tell me which version of Linux you personally recommend to run the controller?</p>

<p>I've looked at the beagleboard and I think it's a good product for the price, but nevertheless I tend more by CuBox, "personal opinion".</p>

I don't know the difference between the "lite" CPU version and the other one but 1GHz and 1GB ram is be fine to run OpenRemote.<br/>
If XBMC is also running, I can't say how that would influence the OpenRemote controller.</p>

<p>did you buy the CuBox PC and did OR controller deployment work? I am interested in your answer, because my OR controller on a RPi is quite slow and as soon as I insert some graphics into the GUI the RPi does not work anymore.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Mark,</p>

<p>Yes, I bought the CUbox, I have not received the CuBox yet because SolidRun has had some delays but I think in early February should be coming.</p>

<p>I bought the model CUbox-i2Ultra but the difference between this and the CUbox-i2 is mostly in the graphics, this means that in terms of performance for OR there should be no difference between model i2 and i2Ultra.</p>

<p>I acquired the mofel i2Ultra because I want to experiment more with my XBMC and I found striking the InfraRed Receiver &amp; Transmitter, the RTC and Battery Backup and the With WiFi + BlueTooth integrated.</p>

<p>I think for those who simply want to use the CUbox as replacement of alternative to the Raspberry and to get more performance with OR, the model i2 is a god i2 choice.</p>

<p>As soon as I receive the CuBox and install OR, I will be sharing my experience with the community.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Kluin, </p>

<p>Yes, I already received the CUbox-i2ultra. </p>

<p>OR works well but I don't think it necessary to acquire the model Ultra to run the controller. SolidRun has discontinued the model "i2Ultra" but the model "i2" should be enough to run the controller smoothly.</p>

<p>I believe that there are many alternatives to run the "Controller" smoothly with a budget under $100.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.element14.com/community/community/knode/single-board_computers">Here you can find some Single-Board Computers</a></p>

<p>You should ask the people who use the "BEAGLEBONE" or "Cubieboard". These miniPC can also be a good alternative to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>I want to to hear the experiences of these users because I'd like to keep experimenting with new miniPC's</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Michal, </p>

<p>Yes, I have considered the eBox but the truth is that for me is important to experiment with miniPC's or Single-Board Computers with a budget under $100 dollars. </p>

<p>Also I think that if the "controller" could be installed on Android, the possibilities to reduce the cost of the console to run the controller would be quite interesting because of the amount of devices on the market that run on android for a budget under $100 dollars. (<a href="http://www.webeeuniverse.com/en/products/gateways">An interesting case is the console (Boss) from Webee</a>).</p>

<p>Do You think that it's possible to create an Android image of the controller to be installed directly on an android miniPc in the same way as the Linux image of the controller for the eBox?.</p>

Can you tell me with which kind of libs did you had problems?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Pieter,</p>

<p>When rereading this thread, I wonder if your question was intended for me. Because my Raspberry PI is still not very responsive (very slow actually) I summarise my set-up: controller on RPi (model B) which connects to KNX via an IP gateway (including light, thermostates, security, floor heating, etc), RRD4J temp graphs, T24 (still experimenting), Denos AVR (still experimenting) and Sonos. I have appr. 500 commands, 200 sensors, 150 switches/sliders. Very limited use of rules. I have a iPad panel with 12 screens, iPhone panel with 10 screens. The iPad screens include 3D floorplans of the house with all the switches, lights, etc 'on' it.</p>

<p>Experience: at the start everything was perfect... but with the heavy use now:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>syncronising designer-controller takes appr. four minutes. Each addition of functionality makes it slower.</li>
	<li>refreshing a panel on the iPhone / iPad takes more than a minute and ends in &gt; 75% in an update error "Use Local Cache - Occured unknown error, satus code is 0"... so, redo, redo, reboot, redo</li>
	<li>when starting the iPhone/iPad I often get the error message "Warning - Occured unknown error, satus code is 0 Using cached content. I first though this might be because not all 'read' flags were set in KXN addresses. But after changing this, nothing improved.</li>
</ul>



<p>I wonder what the impact would be if I would replace the RPi with a more capable machine e.g. Cubox-i with quad core and more memory. I have looked at the Openremote eBox Pro but it has also limited memory/CPU. I wonder if this is enough. And because I intend to add extra functionality like 1-wire temp/humidity, Z-wave power consumption measurement, T24 SIP, streams from Mobitix camera's (not possible in current iOS app), more graphs, I assume I need to increase computing power a lot.</p>

<p>Maybe you have any ideas which could help improve the performance on RPi or suggestions on which machine to move to. Another thing I will need to determine is the speed (or lack of speed) of the KNX IP Interface. This might also prove to be an important bottleneck. Maybe anyone has any thoughts on how to improve this in changing the KNX (ETS) configuration?</p>

<p>PS If I have correctly understood I will have to do all my configuration all over again when moving to the pro-version because I can not import my free designer account.... that does not encourage me to move to the pro-version <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> </p></font>

Yes, the question was intended for you. Thanks for sharing. </p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>What you have is quite a lot for a Pi I think. The Pro version won't make it any easier for the Pi.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The latest Pro 1.0.13 does not have the import function yet. It is now scheduled for 1.1, but at least 1.0.14 is planned between those. I guess the developers will be smart enough to let you import free designer models.<br/>
(I hope Eric can say something more about that)</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>I guess you will have a more powerful Mac/PC around. You could install the controller there and see how your tablet performs.</li>

<p>Eventually, that would be the goal. And that's partially a reason why the export/import hasn't been deployed to Pro, because the implementation we have so far would make that transition too problematic. So we want to find a solution that will work long term.</p></font>

<p>Can you elaborate a bit there ?</p>

<p>If you camera can provide for an MJPEG stream, then using a webview on your UI should work with the iOS console (I've done it using the Mobotix T24 and some Pelco IP cameras).</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Eric,</p>

<p>I am using the webview on iOS but when opening the screen with the webview the picture I get is static. There is no streaming of the image. Because you mention you are also using the T24(mjpeg). Could you point me to the correct parameters to use in de T24 url to get a streaming image please?</p>

<p>Also I am looking how to signal a doorbell ring to the iOS console. Because it is not possible to change screen based on events, I wonder if a sound would be possible? Have found 'text to speech' in the forum but assume this would then trigger sound on de RPi not on the iOS console. Correct?</p></font>

<p>For the doorbell, unfortunately it's not possible at this time. Something interesting to add but I don't see it in the short/medium term.<br/>
In the mean time, maybe the notifications mechanism you've discussed in the other thread can be used. Although not sure what the delay is what notifications, might be too long for " doorbell ring".</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Nice. Any mile stones for the next release known yet?</p>

<p>I can describe my issues maybe a bit more in detail:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>when the "Use Local Cache - Occured unknown error, satus code is 0" error comes up, I sometimes can just just accept that, and the commands still go through, but not always. Most of the times, I have to go to the settings page</li>
	<li>sometimes, all looks good after starting the app, but when I tap on a command button, a popup tells me "Command failed. The command was sent to an invalid URL."</li>
	<li>in all cases, I have perfect WiFi connection, no problem with other apps and the controller screen comes up immediately on the browser</li>
</ul>


<p>Waiting for the next release though.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Pieter,</p>

<p>I have tested for a while with a Windows 7 Professional Dell Laptop with Intel Core i5-3437U, 4Gb RAM, 64 bit and it performed like lightning.<br/>
Some benchmarks:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>configuration update to controller took &gt;4 minutes on the RPi... on the laptop &lt; 10 sec (on Wifi).</li>
	<li>updating the iPad configuration took less than 5 seconds. Most of the time it did not work at all on the RPi.</li>
</ul>


<p>Downside for now: 65W AC adapter and a lot of the config on the Linux needs to be configured and figured out all over again; e.g. Sonos.</p>

<p>Conclusion: I will start looking for a faster but low energy consuming Linux machine.</p></font>

I am not really surprised by the figures. For me the Raspberry is only a gateway to Z-Wave. The OR-controller runs on Synology DS 212+. <br/>
Have you ever tried to look at the load on the Pi during normal operation. The <b>top</b> command on the console can give you some insight. (click on image)</p></font>
