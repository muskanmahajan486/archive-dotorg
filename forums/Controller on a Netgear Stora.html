				    <p>Dear All</p>

<p>Apologies, I know there are other posts asking about Controller installation on STORA NAS, but nothing for over a year, so I thought I'd find out if anyone has actually done it this yet....</p>

<p>I have a great little STORA, and have recently installed Logitech Media Centre on it to serve all my music from it's low power platform. The next step is to get a low power platform to run my OR Controller.... I know, and I saw the great work of the Raspberry PI as a platform, and I am tempted to get one.... but I already have the STORA, so it would be great to run my two server apps (OR and Logitech) from the same platform.</p>

<p>Please tell me if anyone has had any success in this is, and what are the installation instructions.</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>
