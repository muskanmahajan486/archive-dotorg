				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I think in projects like openremote the community is core.  In other projects I've always relied heavily on the great wealth of information from the discussions held by those who've joined perhaps years before me.</p>

<p>However with these forums on OR I find its not easy, actually near impossible to browse and search for info and already I've found myself asking questions that have already been asked.  Plus with other forums elsewhere having a nice interface to browse them means I often get inspired in ways I'd never thought.  For starters we could do with categories such as "x-10", "z-wave", "drools engine", "designer", "my automation" etc etc, and we need a nice search engine.  I'll not teach granny to suck eggs and go naming a few of the many great forum engines out there, but I would like to know if the idea of using them is something that is being considered.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Jonathan.</p>

<p>Recently I started to use OpenRemote to build my first home automation project - "Smart Boiler" based on 1-wire Dual Counter from Hobby Boards <a href="http://www.hobby-boards.com/store/">http://www.hobby-boards.com/store/</a></p>

<p>After about 2 months the project is almost finished. I think in January will make step by step tutorial on how to write rules for Smart Boiler with use of command, switch, range,  structures in droops/java rules.</p>

<p>I think as soon as users will be ready to share such tutorials your idea will be heard by Open Remote developers and they will create an area at the site for enthusiastic users.</p>

<p>As for search engine - it is not perfect but it is fine to search all forums - just type the construction, like Level and you will find (in 1 hour) that to read Level value you need to read it's sensor with structure Range. This was my way to learn.</p>

<p>So the idea is to ask people to create tutorials they used in their projects. At the same time most of us become silent as soon as we got the answer to one's particular question. Only tutorials with complete rule implementation will create Open remote community.</p>

<p>Guys from Open Remote team are able just to answer from time to time to our questions but not to develop the community because it is a great part of job. At the same time very few of us are ready to support community. So who will be the core of this community? Again only some 3-5 persons can answer questions. So let's join them and start writing tutorials and answers to questions of newbie's.</p>

<p>If you have some ready projects, please share. It will be a good example for others. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Alexey, indeed tutorials to create a full application solution are very helpful. Organizing these would be an improvement on the documentation, and we started some first at <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+User+Tutorial">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+User+Tutorial</a>, made by Pieter. Although it is time consuming we welcome contributions here. You can start them on your own private pages, and we can move them to documentation once finished. Look forward to 'The Smart Boiler'!</p></font>

If you are logged in to this forum, you can look into my <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~pz1/My+Pages">private space</a> to see some examples. I have a document template there that I use as a guideline for my pages</p></font>
