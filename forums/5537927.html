				    <p>Hi All,</p>

<p>This is a little OT as it doesn't really relate to using OR at this stage.  <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
But you were amongst the 1st people that came to mind that'd have good exposure to this sort of thing!</p>

<p>If I'm getting the IRTrans Ethernet IR transceiver to plug into my HTPC (FE+BE initially)<br/>
Is it even necessary to bother with IR transmitting IR learning remote?</p>

<p>I mean couldn't the transceiver in theory be the learner/blaster for all my gear?<br/>
So instead of an IR learning remote, I could get a cheap RF non-learning remote, and issue commands via it.<br/>
And those commands could be translated via LIRC + IRTrans Ethernet into IR_send cmds!</p>

<p>Would that be possible or even preferential?</p>

<p>I have already got a WM5 PDA (axim x50v) with a CF IR extender that I could also use as an IR-based learning remote.<br/>
But I'm not sure how usable that is going to be in practice ....<br/>
Most of the major remote programs haven't been developed for years + I prefer a remote form-factor with hard button etc.</p>

<p>Let me know if anything I've said is unclear; ideas/advice greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Jed</p>

<p>Probably possible. If I understood you correctly, you want to receive IR code from any random remote and translate it through LIRC to another IR code. Devil's in the details of course.</p>

<p>Preferred depends on the person. Universal remote saves you from that middle piece with LIRC (learn the original remote codes into universal remote and just point it to your target device). For one device with clean line-of-sight it may be simpler.</p></font>

<p>To be honest I wouldn't have the faintest idea if this is even possible&#33; <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Something like iPod Touch at around $200 does give you a completely customized graphical interface which is much more flexible than memorizing functions mapped to generic button-based remote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the choice comes down to that or a much simpler system like a harmony 890, one, or 900 etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>I would do a price comparison on the cost of iPod Touch + IRtrans vs. Harmony &#8211; some of the higher-end Harmony models can become quite expensive.</p>

<p>It's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison of course &#8211; feature differences in hardware capabilities, size and style + the generic device benefits of iPod Touch (music, games, utlities, app store).  iPod Touch has a higher degree of customizability and programmability compared to Harmony remotes and is going to be still reusable for whatever HA system you end up installing later.</p>
