				    <p>I am trying to get the status of an insteon light switch and cant seem to get it. I'm sure its something simple but beyond me at the moment...</p>

<p>I am setting up a custom command, using the following:<br/>
url: <a href="http://10.0.0.249/rest/nodes/29%20B3%2023%201/ST">http://10.0.0.249/rest/nodes/29%20B3%2023%201/ST</a><br/>
HTTP Method: GET<br/>
user: admin<br/>
pass: (correct password)</p>

<p>Xpath: I've tried multiple versions -<br/>
//properties/property/@value<br/>
concat(//properties/property/@value,"")<br/>
number(concat(//properties/property/@value,""))<br/>
//property/@value</p>

<p>If I browse to the url myself, I get:</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br/>
&lt;properties&gt;<br/>
&lt;property uom="%/on/off" formatted="Off" value="0" id="ST"/&gt;<br/>
&lt;/properties&gt;</p>


<p>I need to pull that value for a range, which will vary from 0 - 255.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Update:<br/>
It seems to be an issue with the http authentication. I created an xml file with the exact same xml info and pointed the sensor to it. That one works fine which is why I think its the authentication, however I know the username and password I have entered are correct since they are the ones I use when I browse to the page manually...</p>

<p>Update 2:<br/>
The minds behind all of this deserve alot of credit for all they've done. I didn't realize that I could simply create an ISY-99 command with ST as the actual command and it would then run that as a status check instead of a command. This is much easier than I was expecting it to be.</p>

<p>Now if only I could figure out why the slider doesn't line up right for what it is telling the switch...</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thank you for the response, Marcus. I would agree with you that I need a command with a polling interval, but I couldn't get that command to get any data because of the authentication issue. What is working for getting the status is this -<br/>
<a class="confluence-thumbnail-link 392x256" href='http://www.openremote.org/download/attachments/22886819/ISY_switch.jpg'><img src="attachments/thumbnails/22886819/23036582" align="absmiddle" border="0"/></a><br/>
It doesn't make sense to me that it works, but I'm not going to question it.<br/>
What is happening with the slider tho is an issue with the ranges they function on. The slider seems to be sending commands based on percent (0%-100%) but I can only read status on a 0-255 scale. For example, when I move the slider to 33%, it sets the light correctly to 84 (33% of 255) but then updates the position of the slider to 84% based on the status returned. I tried setting the slider range to 0-255, but then 98 will set the light to 98% and 102 is back to 2%, same for 198 and 202, and finally 255 (slider all the way) is only 55%.I have the slider using the DON command which for insteon uses a 0-255 scale for commands - <a href="http://wiki.universal-devices.com/index.php?title=ISY-99i_Series_INSTEON:REST_Interface#Commands">http://wiki.universal-devices.com/index.php?title=ISY-99i_Series_INSTEON:REST_Interface#Commands</a><br/>

Advice on correcting the slider would be awesome.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Jesse,</p>

<p>I have checked in a version of the controller and designer which I would expect would provide you a much better experience with the ISY.</p>

<p>The designer can interrogate the ISY for all the devices, and automatically create appropriate commands, sensors, switches and sliders for every element.  It is very similar to Dan's work with the Omnilink.  It just so happens I have 1 house with Omnilink, and another with ISY.</p>

<p>The controller has been upgraded to use a Soap subscription to monitor all status changes via 1 channel, instead of the existing http polling method which really isn't scalable.  I found the ISY starts throwing errors with not too many commands polling.</p>

<p>However, getting your own designer installed at home is no small feat.  It requires knowledge of mysql, tomcat and a few other things.  If you would like to give this a try you can find my changes at:</p>

<p><a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/openremote/code/workspace/craigham/">https://svn.code.sf.net/p/openremote/code/workspace/craigham/</a></p>

<p>It is the two ISY folders.</p>

<p>cheers,<br/>
craig</p>

<p>Marcus, I have a sensor set for 0-255 range and it reads that correctly. Unfortunately, it seems that the command the slider sends is based off percentage, as in 0-100 no matter what I do.</p>

<p>Craig, I would be very interested in setting up my own designer and have a fair amount of dealings with mysql but not much with tomcat. Is there a thread or tutorial somewhere that provides some basic steps for setting up an inhouse designer?</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Jesse,</p>

<p>Here is a recent post of someone who set up designer, beehive and mysql.</p>

<p>Make sure you notice the GWT version that ended up working.  This also tripped me up last year when I set up my environment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Setting+up+local+Beehive,+Designer+and+Controller">http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Setting+up+local+Beehive,+Designer+and+Controller</a></p>

<p>You may want to set up an environment with the builds of controller and designer they used in the post just to limit diversion of steps.  After you get beehive and mysql and the controller/designer working in this article, it would be rather straight forward to download my versions of the designer/controller and you'd be on your way.</p>

<p>Just a warning, it can be painful getting started, but once you have everything working, it really opens up the possibility to make changes, or use some of the bleeding edge enhancements.</p>

And yes, the slider doesn't like the feedback - anything 100 up just sets the slider to max. I probably need to make a macro or rule (I'm a noob here... I don't know what exactly need made) that essentially divides the feedback by 2.5 so it gives the slider the correct data. It would be awesome if it didn't have to be done for each individual switch since there are almost 80 dimmers in this setup to program.</p></font>

<p>I can confirm that this isn't an issue with the Web Console, I created a virtual test slider with a range of 0-255 and it correctly displays and the correct value is sent back to the controller when the slider is changed.</p>

<p>Sounds like a command problem, worth checking on the iOS console though to be sure.</p>

<p>Just to double check, you did define a sensor of type range, defined its min at 0 and max at 255 and used that sensor in your "building modeler slider" definition, then linked that element to your visual slider ?</p>

<p>Also, if you create a label and link the sensor to it, does it correctly display 0-&gt;255 values ?</p></font>

Based on the packets I see being sent, whenever I set the slider the value that is sent to the ISY is whatever the slider is multiplied by 2.55. Since I have the sliders range as 0-255. When I move the slider to full (255) it sends/cmd/DON/650 (which is 255*2.55) and the light sets to 138, which is (650-256)-256.</p>

<p>How do I get rid of that multiplier on the slider?</p></font>
