				    <p>Hello everybody at the OpenRemote forums.</p>

<p>I just started my exploration in home automation, and I am very interested to get some more knowledge about it. I have already downloaded OpenRemote Controler, so the next thing that comes is the hardware.</p>

<p>After reading lots of forums, I am still confused. I don't know exactly, what do I need to buy, to controll my house (light control, TV control, air condition control) with my computer or mobile phone. At first I would like to make a simple task, but I don't want to buy hardware, that will be useless when I add more automation to it.</p>

<p>I don't have much knowledge in computer stuff, but as a student of civil engineering I am willing to learn how to set home automation. Sorry for stupid questions that follows.</p>

<p>So I have computer ( running Windows XP Pro), Iphone. <br/>
Now if I understand right, I need KNX controller which will be connected to my computer. When I will then press for example a switch ON button on my mobile, the order will go wirelessly to my computer, from computer to KNX controller and then the KNX Controller will send IR order to the switch.</p>

<p>Please tell me if I am right or where am I wrong. I would also ask you, to give me some links of controllers and switches that you use and are compatible.</p>

<p>Thank you </p>

<p>For KNX, the flow is from button press on your mobile, to a controller which uses IP network to reach a KNX gateway. The KNX gateway then translates the IP message to an KNX bus message (bus is a KNX wiring that has been installed to your house in this case).</p>

<p>There's no IR involved in this scenario.</p>

<p>With regards to hardware, the answer unfortunately is 'it depends'. There's no single hardware solution that is good at solving all areas of home automation including light control, TV control and HVAC.</p>

<p>You could choose for example KNX or Lutron for lighting and they've got fairly decent HVAC integration options too. For TV control it depends on your TV model, most common is still infrared control in which case something like an IRTrans or GlobalCache could be useful.</p>

<p>Once you have all these pieces together (lights, HVAC, A/V), you can use OpenRemote to integrate them and control all of them from a single unified interface (iOS, Android, Web, etc.)</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>Many Thanks again for your tremendous work on this phenomenal program. I had been looking for a universal remote app/program to run on Android for over a year. The only available apps were (and still are) barely functional. </p>

<p>After discovering OR and spending a couple months reading the forums and the tutorials and videos that you and others have generously posted, I have configured everything to work with Global Cache's ITach. And everything is super slick. Panels designed to control all of my AV equipment. It is unbelievably Slick! I so appreciate OR and I am ready to move to the next level. I have spent hours trying to find the answers (from forums and tutorials) before attempting to ask the following questions. If you have a chance, I would love some advice:</p>

<p>1. I am in the US, and would like the best solution for Android to control lighting, security and hvac. Which is the best hardware?<br/>
2. Where specifically on your site can I find advice/tutorial on how to configure it all?<br/>
3. Is it possible to use OR on Android to control all of this from a remote location via Android?<br/>
4. If so, what specific configs do I need to implement?</p>

<p>Manty Thanks,<br/>
Joe</p>

<p>btw- I can offer up some of the graphics and buttons I've made for Comcast Cable Remote (plus channel buttons), Vulkano, Neothings switch, etc.</p></font>
