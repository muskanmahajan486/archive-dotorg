				    <p>Has anyone integrated these little Kankun Small K switches into openremote ? </p>

<p>im sure it can be done through the webview area</p>

<p>the switches run openwrt and already have a script on the switch which lets me turn it on and off with different web addresses </p>

<p>we have people who made json.cgi and relay.cgi already but im not sure how to call the switch from openremote i have tried a bunch of ways but no luck. </p>

<p>I run my openremote from my Qnap server at home and seems most times when i add new webview items to my design then the panel will not load on my web browser or on my android phone , seems to get stuck in some sort of loading loop so i cant see any of my items ( i also control my home KNX from the openremote app)</p>

<p>the commands by web are: (supposing the switch you want to control is at ip 192.168.10.253)</p>

<p>talking to relay.cgi</p>

<p>From any web browser connected to the plug, you can now issue commands to the smart plug. Change the IP address to the appropriate one for your device.</p>

<p><a href="http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?state">http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?state</a> will inquire whether the relay is on or off. </p>

<p><a href="http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?on">http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?on</a> will tell the smart plug to turn the relay on.</p>

<p><a href="http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?off">http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?off</a> will tell the smart plug to turn the relay off.</p>

<p><a href="http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?toggle">http://192.168.10.253/cgi-bin/relay.cgi?toggle</a> will toggle the relay from on to off, or off to on.</p>

<p>anyway not sure if anyone has done it before ? inf not i would be willing to pay someone (via paypal ) to tell me how to do it .. .</p>

<p>some background from people who made relay.cgi </p>

<p>I would suggest that it would be easy enough to use those commands in the HTTP protocol, within OpenRemote.</p>

<p>Webview isn't the way forward.</p>

<p>The only thing to find out is it the data that is returned from the Status command can be used in an OpenRemote switch sensor.</p>

<p>If it can, you can assign the On &amp; Off commands to an OpenRemote switch too.</p>

<p>Is this enough information for you?</p></font>
