				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>by now I've spent some (many) hours in trying to add all my lights (KNX). Doing so, I came across some issues:</p>

<p>1) The loading time of a dialog to select a command rises potentially with the content. The sensors seem to be cached locally, because the dropdown for the sensors appears instantly despite the dialog for selecting the commands. Caching the commands locally would be a great improvement.</p>

<p>2) Reuse icons within one account. Each switch-icon has to be uploaded (2 icons for one switch), even if its the same I already uploaded. So it seems, that the icon gets a number added to the name, so changing the icon for i.e. light means changing <em>many</em> icons. offering not only the multimedia icons from the global, but offering account icons speeds up setting and changing the icons in the designer</p>

<p>3) Slow connection (client - meaning me) or slow server prevents me now from continuing the work. I cannot upload an icon. It takes about 3 or 4 minutes and stops with the message "please select an icon". hm. I tried to....</p>

<p>4) Cosmetics. Reading the word "demo" within the designer URL makes me feel my work could be deleted on server side, if the project gets out of state demo, or for any other reason.</p>

<p>5) offline working. I can download a ZIP for the controller (containing the XML), so I could write an offline editor, but there ist no chance to re-import the data to the designer for continuing online.</p>



<p>I know I am not right in all my points, because I am very new to OR and so I do not know many things, especially things going around in the background, but doe to I am software developer, may be some day I can attend and help...</p>

<p>Let me know what you think about it, what is planned and mainly - how I can continue working... (sloooow communication and breakdown of the upload)</p>

<p>cheers<br/>
Achim</p>
