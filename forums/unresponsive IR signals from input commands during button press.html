				    <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I have have openremote setup on my android tablet, a QNAP TS-219P II turbo NAS as the controller, and global cache Itach wf2ir module. I have setup the connections for them all and have been successful with controlling my AV equipment from the tablet and openremote touch interface. however, more often than not, I notice there is a significantly long delay between button press and the time the Itach sends the IR signal. Sometimes, it doesn't even send it at all. This is particularly worse when I push multiple buttons in series. the Itach will either have a 5-10 second delay and then send them all at once or if bombarded with too many commands, will skip some of them in between. </p>

<p>Is there a way to fix this to make the responsiveness faster? I have a gigabit connection and I don't think that's an issue. I used to have a pronto and it worked great but I wanted something more customizeable hence I went with openremote. thank you.</p>


<p>is it better to install the controller software on a PC vs. a NAS? I have both setup and can use either but I can't tell which one is generally should be more reliable.</p>

<p>Derek</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi everyone, thanks for your response and input.</p>

<p>Marcus: both machines are running the 2.0 version of the controller. my machines are: <br/>
QNAP TS-219P II turboNAS via ethernet gigabit LAN.<br/>
Dell 710m laptop with pentium M CPU, 1GB RAM running windows XP pro via WLAN wireless G.</p>

<p>the performance of both seems to be the same. I have noticed that bombarding it 5-6 commands in quick sessions will cause it to freeze since the controller needs to catch up.<br/>
Sending 1 command at a time is pretty much instant with about .5 second delay which is acceptable.<br/>
If I don't press anything on the remote for a while and then initiate a command by pressing something whether it's a macro or a single button, it has 5-10 delay before the IR is sent. somethings need to press the command again for it to work. </p>

<p>Summary:<br/>
So based on what I have noticed, it seems that the delay is really that first command being sent from an idle state. Almost seems like the controller has been sleeping and waiting for a wake signal.</p>

<p>Possible causes:<br/>
1. Itach is slow at getting Wifi signal and converting it to IR.<br/>
how to test: I would like to hear other people's experiences have been using openremote to send a IR signal with other devices to test #1.</p>

<p>2. openremote controller falls into a pseudo-sleep mode when touch panel has been idle for a while.<br/>
how to test: maybe a more powerful machine as a controller? Or anyone making modifications/tweaks to the OR software itself.</p>

<p>3. difference in iOS app vs. Android app.<br/>
how to test: Since I have 2 touch devices: iphone and android tablet. I went ahead to see if they perform any differently. results were non-conclusive, so i'll rule out #3.</p>

<p>@ Marko: are you using a Itach as well? if not, what device are you using? I did not program any sensor or traces. It only commands IR signals without any feedback. In fact, sensors are something I am interested in but have no idea how to integrate it into my existing equipment and openremote designer.</p></font>

Also, if you do not use sensors, the sensor polling thread should not do anything.</p>

<p>I would take a close look at the Itach Wifi, but that is just a guess.<br/>
Do you have another software where you can just send commands to the Itach to test this?</p></font>

Could you try and replace the file "Deployer.class" in the folder</p>

<p>"Controller-2.0.0/webapps/controller/WEB-INF/classes/org/openremote/controller/service/"</p>

<p>with the attached version and give it a try.</p>

<p>I replaced the deployer.class file and when i reloaded my hostip:8081/controller, i get a " An attempt was made to access service context before it was initialized" in red. I created a new folder as to create a new controller but still give me the same problem. is the issue from file or something else?</p>

<p>i also SSH and changed the directory path in the autorun file.</p>

<p>thank you.</p></font>

<p>no, I'm only using a KNX Gateway in my setup. Regarding the logging disabling, I did changes not only in the config file Markus mentioned but also in other ones. Unfortunately I don't have the changes out of my head. Let me check when I'm back home and send you an update.   </p>

<p>O.k. here we go.<br/>
I changed  : <br/>
log4j.properties in webapps/controller/WEB-INF/classes which is for the controller itself<br/>
logging.properties conf/  which I guess is for the tomcat/catalina part<br/>
Basically I've changed all logging levels to = OFF <br/>
After restarting the controller you should noticed that there is no increase of log files under the log folder /log<br/>
For better verification you can delete all log files.  </p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Allen,</p>

<p>I did look at the controller.xml file that you sent to Marcus and have a few questions.</p>

<p>I see a lot of buttons that have multiple times the same command (for instance for volume up / down).<br/>
I suppose this is because you created a macro and you did assign that volume up command multiple times to it.<br/>
What is your purpose there? Is it to raise/lower the volume more than with a single press?</p>

<p>If this is the case, I believe this might be the issue because the way OR handles macros.<br/>
For macros, OR will execute each command in the macro in turn and insert a delay in between each command. Also, control will not return to the console until the macro has finished execution.<br/>
I'll take a closer look at the code when I get a bit of time to double-check / see how to improve that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, can you go in the designer into the "Config for Controller" pane and check under macro. There is where the default delay is configured, which by default is 500 ms. Try reducing that to maybe 10 and see how to works out.</p>

<p>More specifically for this case, instead of using a macro to just repeat the same volume command 10 times, you would be better off using the repeat feature of the sendccf command that the GlobalCaché supports.</p></font>

<p>I changed the delay from 500 to 10. then i deleted the volume macro and added new IR command for the volume up and down but changed the repeat to 10 and 20. I will test this out in a few days. Thank you for yours and Marcus's support.</p>

<p>@Marko: thanks for the location of the files. I will have to play around with those files in a few days. </p>

<p>I modified the log files Marko directed me and changed everything (levels and threshold) to OFF. I also changed the all the maxbackupindex to 0. However, the log files are still being created after reboot though there is no content written in them.</p>

<p>when I use the macro to turn on all my AV equipment, it still takes 6-8 seconds. I might need to modify my macros and streamline things to make things cleaner. if immediately after the first command after a period of no activity i give another non-macro command, it responds fast (normal). however, if i don't do anything a while, the command is delayed. I have 2 controllers and this was tested on the Marvell CPU QNAP NAS on a gigbit LAN with the modified class files and log files along with changes to the config controller in designer as directed by Eric.</p>

<p>my pentium M laptop running the unaltered version of controller 2.0 on wirelessG seems to respond much faster. </p>

<p>I think it might be due to the process not being fast enough to handle the communication between devices. however, the changes made in designer improved the response time noticeably under the pentium controller. I have not tested this machine much so I will have to see how it behaves over time and if this level of performance can be maintained, even though inactivity for long periods of time.</p></font>
