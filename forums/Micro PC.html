				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a raspberry pi2 B and do far I am somewhat happy with it except for the speed. With just running OR controller pro and the pro designer when I go to sync, I find it to take maybe 3-5 minutes to sync the designer with the controller. I purchased a Z-stick 5th generation but am hesitant in using it as I have the feeling that it may bog down the pi. I may try and delete all of the un-necessary programs just to make space and to speed performance I am looking to upgrade to maybe something like an ebox or similar. Can someone point me in the right directions as to which model is good? I am using this for my home automation system.</p>

<p>Devin</p>
