				    <p>IS it possible to get open controller to run within XBMC on its internal webserver. I would imagine running on the old apple tv would be possible given it is a simple variant of OSX. If this could be run within XBMC then with the latest update you can now run XBMC on the new apple TV. </p>

<p>My thinking is simple that Open Remote running on the new Apple TV would be an extremely cost effective way of providing open remote controller servers for very low cost and low power consumption. </p>

<p>Given the open source community has ported XBMC to apple tv does this potentially pen the door for this community looking at this. I'm always continuous of the power requirements of running a full automated home theater without the capability to turn everything off completely. Havnig the server component means it and my GC-100 need to be running. </p>

<p>In an ideal world this would be on the lowest power consuming device, a second option which I've always looked for is for this to be ported to be able to run on one of the available NAS boxes that are also available and are low power. </p>

<p>It is on my ToDo list, and right now I've only installed java with apt-get. It is version 5 and as far as I know OR used 6. Anyway, I'm curious if OR can be run on this java:</p>
