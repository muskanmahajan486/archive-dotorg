				    <p>Hello, I try to find someone who can help me.<br/>
I intend to follow as much as possible the recommended, officially supported devices.<br/>
I bought an ebox, preinstalled with the controller software.<br/>
My AV receiver is a Denon (what a luck)</p>

<p>Is there someone reading this who is in the same situation and got the denon listening to the serial commands?</p>

<p>I did not...</p>

<p>I would be gratefull if someone could help. Either because he has the same setup, or because he knows what the problem is.</p>

<p>I'm not fluent in linux commandlines, but I can type <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I didn't find any serial port parameters in the denon related files, except the portnumbers. Tried them all...</p>

<p>I would be very happy if someone could help me. I intend to use the ethernet connection for feedback, as the serial part is not supporting the feedback<br/>
later on I would like to add a Zwave usb stick, so the usbports, I prefer to leave them free.</p>

<p>thx in advance</p>

<p>Olivier</p>
