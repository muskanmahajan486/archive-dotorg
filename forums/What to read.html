<p>Firstly, you gotta say 'wow'.&nbsp; This project looks absolutely wonderful.  I've spent literally a few hours trying to comprehend the technology and understand the use cases.  As I start to see the potential, I am getting more excited and would like to get up and running.</p>

<p>I am just a small home user, who currently controls a tv/amp/bd palyer/mythtv/ubuntu box using a Logitech one controller.   I've dreamed of having a more integrated solution which provides feedback and maximises the use of a touch panel.</p>

<p>The first question - if I may ask - is 'what project documentation should I be reading?' to accelerate my learning of OR.  I've downloaded the controller, logged into the designer but currently have no physical panel device.  Personally, I understand a bit about the tech space we're in but would welcome a few pointers with the best way to get going.</p>

<p>Using the designer whenever I use the 'test ui...' option the link provided results in an empty page with OK displayed&#33;  Not sure if this is work in progress.</p>

<p>Is there a command which allows the controller to execute a shell command? As well as X10, http, tcp/ip? Does the tcp/ip command provide a way of just using UDP?</p>

<p>Early days for me, but I am really surprised this project is just not full of people.  Seems like this could well be under radar for a lot of people who will be blown away when the new panel interfaces land and they also see the potential.</p>

<p>Brilliant work and who ever designed this .... smart architecture, nice.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>We are working on documentation and video tutorials to help people get started (what equipment is needed, how to create designs and so on). At the moment most documentation is reference material.</p>

<p>'Test UI' is still a bit untested (pun) in the designer, will work on making it better.</p>

<p>TCP/IP is just for TCP at the moment. UDP would not be a difficult addition for one-way commands if you're looking to contribute (Java provides pretty well documented UDP APIs).</p>

<p>The one thing about both UDP/TCP/HTTP generic connectors is that they're mainly suitable to one-way commands at the moment. For feedback, you are likely to need a device specific protocol implementation (e.g. Yamaha HTTP response parsing and so on) which at the moment is a Java implementation. We're working on getting scripting bolted in here to avoid low level programming access requirement.</p>

<p>Early days for us too but are happy to receive any help whether testing/user feedback/protocol implementations/documentation.</p>

<p>Juha and Marc thank you for your positive and upbeat replies.</p>

<p>It's all very fascinating, and unbelievable from my perspective to find this project which feels so right,and offered on a zero cost model.  Though I appreciate, and respect the fact that you are funding this project with both money and time, and best of all ideas.</p>

<p>Juha you did start to elaborate around the area I was trying to understand.  How does the panel get feed back?  This is one of the many areas that differentiates OR from other solutions, lets say a normal remote.  A normal remote can't&nbsp; tell what the  current volume of the TV is, only that you can turn the volume up or down.  With your panels for example they could show a slider to indicate to the current volume level, or show if a device is on or off .</p>

<p>For my simple scenario for example, I'd love to glance down at the panel and see that the MythTV box was off - press a button, one WOL later... it's on.  Or my partner might have already switched it on using the traditional remote, but the smart panel knows this and reflects that the device is on through the user interface. This is such a leap forward from today's remotes.</p>

<p>For you guys, this is simple stuff.  For me, as a user this is why I would a make a change and move to an OR solution.  There's always got to be a reason for change whether it is a simple change at home, or a reason to invest millions in big business.  No one makes change for the simple sake of change, they make change to drive value, make improvements, make savings etc.</p>

<p>Now that I'm here, I'll wait patiently for each new nugget and pick up as much as I can.    I would like to contribute if I can, but (always a damn but) I am flat out at my day job, and time is so limited.</p>

<p>Saying all of that, my trade is in the right place to help.  And though I don't develop any more, I did spend quite a few years in the J2EE space.  So maybe when I get going, I could help test, or if I get time write a few words if it helps the community.  I don't think I have the time to code.  But baby steps for me.&nbsp; I guess I am saying the fact that the documentation is growing, and that I might need to work a few things out is not going to be a barrier.</p>

<p>Thank you chaps, for all your giving.</p></font>

<p>In theory. There's a lot of ifs and buts with this though. One is that most infrared control is one-way only, so you can't get an exact status of what the device is in (such as TV volume). It looks like this year IP connections to top-range TVs are becoming pretty standard, so there's hope for better control (and then there's Google TV). There are some TV brands that allow serial connections also which gives bidirectional control.</p>

<p>So at the end of the day, we too have to live with whatever control interface the hardware manufacturers offer. And that there's no standardization there means a simple issue such as volume control can become a pain in the neck (unless you go for very specific models where you know you have controls beyond basic infrared).</p>

<p>MythTV does have an IP interface if I recall correctly, I think Marcus Redeker used it with his Telnet protocol plugin already.</p>

<p>Since MythTV is such a popular product, I would be interested in adding a dedicated protocol support for it (rather than everyone having to set up generic IP protocol commands) and adding read commands for status where available. So if you fancy some protocol coding in Java, let us know.</p>

<p>Same applies to the Yamaha protocol Pierce is talking about. These are fairly simple to implement, just need to take the time to type them down (and currently requires some familiarity with Java, will be adding scripting here later).</p></font>

<p>Yes the OR service can only be as informative as the device to which it communicates.&nbsp; I used the TV as an example, maybe I should have used an amp as a better example as these are now coming with control protocols as standard (xml over http, uPnp - SOAP, tcp/ip et al).&nbsp; Therefore a panel could should show 'state' if the device supported 'getting' the state through an API. A lot of people serve music in their homes using computers, so this is very natural use case for a next gen remote such as OR.&nbsp; Therefore for someone like myself, I'd be interested in using OR with MPD.  Again MPD has various API's which could be used, which provide state.</p>

<p>MythTV does have an IP interface, and telnet protocol.&nbsp; In addition there are also python bindings.  Getting this to work would be an integration activity, I would doubt that any development would be needed, it's just integration using the wonderful environment you have provided.</p>

<p>I have just read Marc's blog entry on state and MVC patterns - it does make complete sense, and was exactly what I was thinking but as you mention it's only possible if a device has that  core capability and that capability is exposed by some sort of API.</p>

<p>For me, I'm happy to have a play (when I have time), and just create a simple panel interface which turn computers on and off on my home net.  It would also show the state of each computer.  This would be a marvellous baby step.</p>

<p>Have a great day chaps.  I need to spend sometime looking at OR, as the more I chat with you guys the more I actually want to use your product.  I am not shy of Java development and will have a look at the code base when I can - I've checked it out of SVN.&nbsp; But I don't think I will have time to commit to any development apart from maybe coding integration plugins if and as needed.</p>


<p>Can I just say thank you one more time.</p></font>

As&nbsp; I don't own an iThingy or an android, should I belooking at the web panel inteface as a panel interface that I can play with from the desktop?<br/>
And finally - I know it takes time and money but - have you considered a wiki (MoinMoin et al) where people could share their workings or 'how to' documentation.&nbsp; I am a fan of Alfresco (wiki.alfresco.com) and the way they manage their techical documnents online seems to work nicely.<br/>
Thanks for all the info so far and have a wonderfull rest of the week.</p></font>
