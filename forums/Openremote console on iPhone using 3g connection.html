				    <p>Hi.</p>

<p>I have made a simple console that now works on my iPhone. However accessing this console while being connected to 3G does not work.<br/>
I have made needed configurations for making the controller available on internet, and i can access it from my iPhone while being connected to public Wlan, but 3g does not work.</p>

<p>If i open openremote app while connected to 3g, it only closes<br/>
If i switch to 3G wile having the app open, i will get a message saying "Can't download image from Server, there is no network"</p>

<p>I googled this error message and found a code file on SVN from the iPhone app. To me it looks like there is a function named "checkWhetherNetworkAvailible" that throws this exception if it fails.</p>

<p>Could anyone comment on this ? Is it by design that the iPhone app only supports Wifi connection ? <br/>
If so, are there any plans for removing this limitation ?<br/>
Are there any workarounds ?</p>


<p>Thank you<br/>
Best regards<br/>
Bjørn Tore</p>

The connection code still needs some review.</p>

<p>I'll do some more testing with 3G when reviewing that code, but no promise on when I'll get to that.<br/>
If somebody with iOS dev experience wants to check it, just let me know and I'll check the status of the work on that bit of code.</p></font>
