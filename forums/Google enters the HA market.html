                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thanks for posting the link. If you find more analysis what it might mean in terms of the HA please do add to this thread, would be interested in reading it.</p>

<h2><a name="GoogleenterstheHAmarket-WhatDoesItMean%3F"></a>What Does It Mean?</h2>

<p>We've tried to figure out what exactly it all means. It's quite fuzzy still, and lots of detail is missing.</p>

<p>First up was the intent : the <b>big</b> announcements were around media streaming service (Amazon very recently announced the same) and the Android Accessory API (based on Arduino, yay!). That makes sense to Google from strategic point of view and both are directly aimed at Apple.</p>

<p>In that context the whole HA announcement seemed a little bit of a side-show. So we were trying to figure out if Google the advertising company is getting into HA with a real push (serious partnership money required from their part) or whether the demo was more of a "party-trick" to show what could be done with the Android Accessories vs. what Google will put serious weight behind in terms of creating a new market opportunity for them &#8211; and for the record, getting a standardized USB API from Android side to dedicated HA extensions would have tons of potential.</p>

<p>The one tidbit that was revealed there was that they are working with some LED lights OEMs to demo light switches by end of 2011. That is the interesting bit to watch. If they do plan on building a serious HA ecosystem around Android, establishing similar relationships they've done with Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Sony Ericsson in the cell phone world would be necessary. Google should be looking for partners in the area of HVAC, Security, multi-media (they've got Google TV, that's a good start), even healthcare to get to a complete residential automation solution. It's a large, extremely fragmented field and a big name like Google pushing for some unification would be very welcome.</p>

<p>So watching whether there's a desire, will (investment) and understanding of the need to build the partnership network is one way of measuring whether this effort will take off or if it will fizzle like a Google Wave.</p>

<p>The second part is the wireless protocol itself that was mentioned. Sounded like could be a new proprietary entrant to the wireless sensor network field because little detail was given. Whether it builds upon 802.15.4, 6LowPAN or anything in that direction would be interesting to know. It can potentially make things more complicated in terms of technology choices if it is a new entry, or it can put some serious weight behind one of the existing WSN options if one has been chosen. Will be <b>very</b> interesting to see what emerges there too.</p>

<p>Getting one clear direction on wireless sensor transport would be very welcome (we like 6LowPAN here).</p>

<p>Whatever the case, and especially if its a new wireless protocol, the approach Google seems to be taking there is to get a vendor buy-in (the previous point about a LED light OEM) &#8211; and for a company with the money and brand recognition of Google that does make sense. It does not however remove the reality of how slowly consumer space updates hardware in general (do you want to buy a new TV again?) and residential buildings in particular (your boiler is from what year again?). So in those terms if we think about the HA market as a whole where a fully automated solutions are possible, integration will still be key for long time to come. No details yet on how legacy integrates with the all-new Google HA with from-scratch approach. Yet another key point to watch as the year progresses. </p>

<p>And having said that, if the Google effort will be successful and there's a serious push on this, getting something to emerge <b>long-term</b> as potentially ubiquitous HA stack would be a very big deal.</p>

<p>The other great long-term side-effect of ubiquitous runtime (Android) and protocol (currently unknown) is that it would completely commoditize the controller and transport protocols which would benefit everyone and grow the market place immensely. Focus would then move to building tools for professionals and pro-sumers.</p>


<h2><a name="GoogleenterstheHAmarket-WhatDoesItMeanForOpenRemote"></a>What Does It Mean For OpenRemote</h2>

<p>So we were thinking what would an announcement like the above mean for OpenRemote. Mind you there are big caveats here, first with if Google is really serious about HA or if they just wanted to build a party-trick to make Accessory API look cool and second if they've analyzed what it would really mean for them to enter a HA market (they are an advertizing company after all).</p>

<p>Anyway, let's assume Google is serious about it because that is the most exciting scenario <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>In terms of controller, the runtime would clearly shift towards Android. We've been going back and forth about this a for long time, not really getting to a decision whether go with a full Java SE or go with Android (great for embedded which is where the controller will eventually live).</p>

<p>On a tangent, I'm gonna take a dig at Google here for messing up the Java compatibility issue with Android. They dropped the ball there. Had they stuck with WORA the above would be a non-decision. Now Android is an extra effort. Boo to Google for not living up to Java's WORA promise. Double-boo.</p>

<p>Ok, that out of the way, controller running on Android would become a clear target. The big extra effort there is to port all the cool Java libraries (rule engines, scripting languages, and the such) that we want to use to Android. But once done, an Android controller is easily embedded into very small devices, merged with your panel hardware, hidden away, whatever. One less piece of hardware and one less install to deal with. Goodness.</p>

<p>In terms of the wireless protocol that we know nothing about, it would be an obvious candidate for a back-bone transport protocol that is much, much needed. We've got the IP Ethernet for wired installations but we do need a clear back-bone for the wireless sensors (and WiFi isn't it). At OpenRemote we don't care if that ends up being Z-Wave, Zigbee, 6LoWPan, or something from Google (but we like 6LoWPAN, did I say?) because we are agnostic but having some clarity in the industry of how frames are transported between controllers, sensors and devices would certainly be a big deal. For <b>everyone</b>. More time spent on building what matters and less time spent on twiddling bits trying to map signed and unsigned, big-endian and little-endian, whatever.</p>

<p>Finally, the Android Accessory DevKit will be very very interesting &#8211; and the only part that looks more or less concrete right now. Whether its an IR extender to your Android Hardware device, or a wall-mount frame (maybe with some key physical buttons) for your Android tablet it will create a standard eco-system of hardware extensions. This wasn't targeted by Google to HA specifically but it will make a difference in HA and will be a big boon for anybody wanting to build Android-based and Android-integrated HA extensions.</p>


<h2><a name="GoogleenterstheHAmarket-ThisWillBeGood"></a>This Will Be Good</h2>

<p>Bottom-line: exciting announcement from Google!</p>

<ol>
	<li>Hope they're serious about HA beyond producing a cute party-trick at keynote.</li>
	<li>Moving towards a less-fragmented ecosystem with Android as runtime, Android Accessory API and wireless transport would be a huge deal for everybody</li>
	<li>Watching and waiting for some serious partner network push here</li>
	<li>Using Arduino is awesome!</li>
	<li>Getting some installers pulled into this because of Google brand and weight would sure help</li>
	<li>OpenRemote will for sure want to participate <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></li>
	<li>At the very minimum the Android Accessory API and using Arduino will help.</li>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>They're serious about Android@Home, it's not only a fancy trick. That's for sure!</p>

<p>About the protocol, the guy with the strange hair says "For appliances that cannot connect to WiFi, we have designed an OPEN WIRELESS PROTOCOL that allows Android devices to talk to them. This new protocol enables very low-cost connectivity...". </p>

<p>So, there are two possible scenarios here, I think:<br/>
1. The first is they have developed a whole new protocol stack for HA. That means a new physical layer protocol, a new data layer protocol, a new network protocol, a new transport protocol, and a new application protocol. AND THIS IS A LOT OF WORK! However Google is one of the few companies in the world that can afford it...</p>

<p>2. The second scenario is to lay on 6lowPAN or at least on 802.15.4 for the physical layer. This is more likely to be the truth. There are already very low-cost 802.15.4 modems and also MCUs with integrated modems from several big manufacturers like Atmel, TI, Freescale and many others. The radio frequency will be almost for sure 2.4GHz as this is the only free band that is allowed both in Europe, USA and... I think worldwide. So, if they want a world domination (and they're Google, right?), they will like to use 2.4GHz.</p>

<p>The other thing that gives me a reason to think that they will use 6lowPAN is that the guy says "For appliances that cannot connect to WiFi". So, I think Google's protocol is only application layer protocol, something like xAP and xPL, and they will rely on TCP or more probably UDP as transport layer and IP (probably IPv6) for addressing. At least this would be the smart way to do it.</p>

<p>I am very excited about this news too. The HA market really needed a kick from a company like Google!</p></font>

I mean a lot of google is driven by "engineers doing cool stuff" which may be cool and relevant or cool and irrelevant (see wave as many people have pointed out).  </p>

<p>But yeah the RF protocol is interesting.  I am still trying to understand where it comes from.  Is it a stunt pulled by the "lighting science folks" to try and impose their open sourced protocol a la zig-bee? Or is it a requirement of Goog? I wish we had more details. </p></font>

<p>Thanks Juha I recently came across this, in particular the comments:
<a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/google-lighting-science-working-on-open-source-home-wireless-protocol/">http://gigaom.com/cleantech/google-lighting-science-working-on-open-source-home-wireless-protocol/</a><br/>
If it's true then what they have planned, may indeed have a big impact. Questions that spring from it:</p>

<p>(1)<br/>
will these data tx/rx led lights require a data/power Ethernet back-bone? </p>

<p>(2)<br/>
Or can they be retrofitted in any traditional home, &amp; just pass data around the LAN via some form of mesh networking?</p>

<p>(3)<br/>
Or both?</p>

<p>Better chance of taking-off if (2) or (3), so long as it performs well/reliably.</p>

<p>(4)<br/>
is Android really that awesome as a controller platform instead of raw/unadulterated GNU/Linux?<br/>
Aren't there some really big caveats in adopting android as the controller platform?<br/>
e.g. the case Oracle/Sun has against Google + the fact that Android "still" isn't truly open. <br/>
Despite the "illusion" they've tried to give over recent years...</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>As far as I read the transceivers will work on several frequencies - 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in USA, not 2.4GHz as I presumed. These frequencies are not so crowded as 2.4GHz and provide better penetration inside the buildings than ZigBee. They will use 802.15.4 as physical layer. If they use 6loWPAN as Juha says, then everything seems to be more than perfect! 6loWPAN provides better mesh logic than ZigBee, based on IPv6 addressing. Also it integrates seamlessly with the existing Internet protocols and services without a gateway like ZigBee, Z-Wave and every other wireless/powerline HA technology.</p>

<p>Jed, I think you will need an Ethernet backbone or at least a WiFi router to communicate with your Android device. Then you will need an Ethernet/WiFi -&gt; 868 MHz/915 MHz adapter that will communicate with the light-bulbs.</p>

<p>It will be something like this:</p>

<p>Android device &lt; -----<del>WiFi</del>------ &gt; WiFi router &lt; -----<del>Ethernet</del>----- &gt; Android@Home gateway &lt; --------<del>868 MHz/915 MHz</del>-------- &gt; End devices (lights, security, HVAC, etc.)</p>



<p>Maybe in some future Android tablets and phones there will be built-in 868 MHz/915 MHz transceiver and you will be able to communicate with the home directly.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Zigbee Smart Energy 2.0 is a layer on top of 6lowpan/ROLL, the old Zigbee networking stack is gone. But the Zigbee developers can't help themselves and they are patenting the application layer and asking for royalties. The chip makers in the Zigbee Alliance don't want this, but all of the software types do want it. Consequentially many external companies are simply ignoring Zigbee Smart Energy since they can't even answer the basic question of what is patented and what are the royalties. One would hope that Google is developing a SE 2.0 equivalent application layer free of the Zigbee Alliance patent nonsense.</p>

<p>Once everyone goes 6lowpan the physical layers become meaningless. It doesn't matter if you are on 900Mhz, 2.4Ghz, whatever since everything is TCP/IP based and the application is unaware of the PHY layer. 802.15.4 is spec'd at both 900Mhz and 2.4Ghz. TI offers chips in both bands. While 900Mhz does penetrate better it needs a much larger antenna. Not the kind of thing you want on alarm or temperature sensors. You can make 2.4Ghz antennas 15mm x 15mm.</p>

<p>The Google bulb is a parlor trick. No one is going to want light bulbs that have to be mail ordered in their houses but hackers. The rest of the world will stick with bulbs that can be bought in a grocery store.</p>

<p>If you want to play with 2.4Ghz 6lowpan a cost effective way is with the Econtag.
<a href="http://www.redwirellc.com/store/node/1">http://www.redwirellc.com/store/node/1</a></p>

<p>Lots of software here:
<a href="http://mc1322x.devl.org/">http://mc1322x.devl.org/</a></p>

<p>The Econtag has a fairly complete IPv6 6lowpan/ROLL implementation and it can be programmed using free dev tools. The 6lowpan code is all open source.</p>

<p>You will soon discover that a critical piece on Linux is missing. No has yet funded development for 6lowpan/ROLL support on Linux. A proposal was made this year to CE Linux forum but it was beyond their budget. The implementation effort needed is too large for a hacker to handle, several have tried and given up. Without direct Linux support gatewaying into the 6lowpan net becomes a complex routing problem that needs to manually set up on each machine.</p>

<p>The reason why no vendor has done this yet is that they are all still shipping Zigbee 1.0. Licensing for all Zigbee protocols is not compatible with the GPL. This has resulted in everyone implementing their own Zigbee 1.0 stack in user space.</p></font>

<p>However I think this or other open source projects (like openHAB, Domogik, DOG OSGi) will have their share on the market. Don't forget that Android@Home is just another proprietary technology that will work only with Android devices and domotics hardware from several companies. What if you want to use 1-wire sensors or you want to control your old TV with IR, or your AC with IR? Or you want to use your iPad or Windows 7 tablet as HA interface? This is where softwares like OpenRemote are strong, because they combine several different technologies and build unified logic and interfaces above them.</p>

<p>However I think Android@Home will have big impact on the HA market. Google has the power (and the will) to make it a mass product. This is not true with KNX or Control4 for example.</p></font>

Not much information has been released yet, so I'm a bit irritated how an android device is going to talk to the bulb? Do you really think that there has to be some kind of additional transceiver to communicate to all that end devices? Or will the android device be able to talk to them by transmitting via radio on 868/915 MHz directly? Is a smartphone capable of doing so anyway or does it have to use the higher wlan frequency for this purpose? I think it should be capable, because it is almost the GSM band, isn't it? Thank you!

Today's Android devices don't have built-in 802.15.4 chips, but I guess sooner or later the manufacturers will put one as they do now with the NFC chips. I think 802.15.4 is going to be a mass standard for command &amp; control devices, because ZigBee, 6loWPAN and several proprietary protocols (more precisely - protocol stacks) uses it as physical layer.</p>

<p>So, for now the only way accessing the bulb is by some king of gateway between 802.15.4 and Ethernet/WiFi. Please, see my previous post from May 17th for more info. Be aware that all this are just guesses and assumptions.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Well, it's a really long topic. Now home automation is mainly for millionaires with houses that are designed to be automated (i.e. needs special cabling and hardware like motorized shutters). There are companies that are specialized in KNX, ZigBee (Control4 in the USA), BTicino and other proprietary hi-end (that means expensive) HA technologies. In most cases you can't just buy and install your own HA system. This is not an easy job and in many cases you will need special programmers and/or software for programming the modules that also cost a lot. I tell you all this because I think this is not the target of OpenRemote and the other open source HA projects. In most cases you go to a company that will install you a Gira KNX stuff for example, and you will use Gira's fancy touch UI for several K Euro.</p>


<p>Of course there is the crappy X10, Insteon in the USA, HomeMatic/FS20 in Germany and Z-Wave (in Europe, mainly in Germany) and some other technologies that are relatively cheap and relatively easy for install by hobbyists and enthusiasts. I think this is the target of OpenRemote and the other open source projects.</p>


<p>I think Google looks at the end users. They provide an "open" proprietary protocol (remember KNX?), relatively cheap hardware from their partners (however $30 for a bulb is not cheap for me) that anybody can "install" in his home. This will blow the HA market, especially in the USA. Most of the people will be happy enough to switch ON and OFF some lights by their phone. However many technically people (like me) will want to do a lot more with a lot more devices and interfaces. So, here comes again OpenRemote and the others.</p>

<p>I tell all this just to clarify that there are two groups of people - "technical enthusiasts" and "regular (dumb) users". The first group of people is very small and the second group will never hear about OpenRemote <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Sad, but true. I hope that answers your question.</p>


<p>P.S. About the other projects:</p>

<p>OpenHAB (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/openhab/">http://code.google.com/p/openhab/</a>) - really great OSGi based software. It's strong side is the weak side of OpenRemote - the scripting engine. It's weak side is the strong side of OpenRemote - the interfaces.</p>

<p>Domogik (<a href="http://www.domogik.org/">http://www.domogik.org/</a>) - another great software written by some French guys in python. It's till in the very beginning and doesn't provide a lot of functionality, but has great future if they do what they have in mind.</p>

<p>DOG (<a href="http://elite.polito.it/dog-tools-72">http://elite.polito.it/dog-tools-72</a>) - another OSGi based software. I didn't have installed it yet. It doesn't provide ready to use interface.</p></font>

<p>But the Zigbee developers can't help themselves and they are patenting the application layer and asking for royalties. The chip makers in the Zigbee Alliance don't want this, but all of the software types do want it. Consequentially many external companies are simply ignoring Zigbee Smart Energy since they can't even answer the basic question of what is patented and what are the royalties.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow... that's really disappointing to hear. Not good for adoption. 6LoWPAN does look good. But it will also need application level protocols at some points, sounds like those are waiting to emerge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once everyone goes 6lowpan the physical layers become meaningless. It doesn't matter if you are on 900Mhz, 2.4Ghz, whatever since everything is TCP/IP and based and the application is unaware of the PHY layer. 802.15.4 is spec'd at both 900Mhz and 2.4Ghz. TI offers chips in both bands. While 900Mhz does penetrate better it needs a much larger antenna. Not the kind of thing you want on alarm or temperature sensors. You can make 2.4Ghz antennas 15mm x 15mm.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>The projects you're talking about are quiet different...</p>

<p><a href="http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/">http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/</a><br/>

<p><a href="http://www.domogik.org">http://www.domogik.org</a><br/>
Based on xPL (<a href="http://xplproject.org.uk/">http://xplproject.org.uk/</a>), it's a way to organize and run together xPL dedicated plugins.</p>

<p><a href="http://elite.polito.it/dog-tools-72">http://elite.polito.it/dog-tools-72</a><br/>
It's more a research and intelligence group around high-tech than a user oriented project with commercial use in consumer electronics.</p>

It's the closest to OR in my opinion even if OR technology runs at a lower level than OpenHab. OR will certainly be more optimized to be embeded in ready to uses consumer electronics products.</p>

<p>Do the OR specialists agree ?</p>

<p>Please tell me if I'm wrong... Thanks</p>

<p>is Android really that awesome as a controller platform instead of raw/unadulterated GNU/Linux?<br/>
Aren't there some really big caveats in adopting android as the controller platform?<br/>
e.g. the case Oracle/Sun has against Google + the fact that Android "still" isn't truly open.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>Where it is good is that it gives a reasonable software layer <b>on top of Linux</b> that runs on ARM platforms, the Dalvik VM, without a cost to software developers (what the cost is to OEMs I don't know).</p>

<p>Where it is not great is that it is a Dalvik VM, not a Java VM (see my mini-rant on the original post). So we are always asking "does it work on Android" when choosing from an existing huge collection of libraries that are available.</p>

<p>So it's not so much about the Linux OS that matters at application development level because the application development has moved higher up to the stack to the various VM layers in many cases. </p>

<p>Ideal would be Java SE on ARM (as an app developer, the operating system is irrelevant to me) but that didn't get adopted for whatever reason, possibly because of the per-device royalty model. So now we have Dalvik VM which is getting adopted by huge numbers despite the cost, if any, to OEMs and to some extent despite the fact that porting the software to Android is an additional cost.</p>

<p>The lawsuit is a red herring IMO, it will get settled one way or another. Business as usual, it is two companies negotiating a price at this point, most likely. Where the "openness" question falls I'm not even sure yet, haven't seen anyone pin their complaints down to something concrete to analyze.</p>

<p>Also it integrates seamlessly with the existing Internet protocols and services without a gateway like ZigBee, Z-Wave and every other wireless/powerline HA technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>The integration is a big point that I like about 6LoWPAN having recently looked into how to deal with bridging and gateways on ZigBee. Getting on to the backbone directly will be helpful (let's face it, everyone's going to have an Ethernet IP network) and it makes integration of controllers, processors and other additions that need visibility to lower level frames potentially easier.</p>

<p>Make it easy to integrate and you have a winner.</p>

<p>While I'm optimistic, I do think the mix and match of different physical layers is still going to cause some headaches until things settle down a bit and wrinkles have been ironed out.</p>

<p>What I do care about is how I install the OpenRemote software on whoever's gateway &#8211; gimme hardware with modern software layer support (Java VM, Dalvik VM) that I can use for hosting the software. And from there things take off towards multiple random directions depending what people need / innovate. In that sense, there's a reason to be quite optimistic about what Google might do in this space.</p>

<p>It does make porting the controller software to Android more relevant, something we've discussed on and off already. But whether and when still depends on what Google actually releases. It doesn't mean OR on Android exclusively, there's still the Java SE version for other gateways if necessary &#8211; unless Google completely owns the gateway space in which case there might be little incentive for other platforms &#8211; but such a thing would still be far off from where things stand today.</p>

<p>There's still going to be a need for a controller of some sort that does your automation, executes your rules and runs your scripts. And most of all that <b>integrates</b> &#8211; since it will take years and years for people to update their devices to something that might become available in 2012 (the point about watching whether Google makes an OEM partnership push in my original post).</p>

<p>Also note that UI's are not necessarily superficial or easy &#8211; see where the existing large HA integrators make most of their money on <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>However I think this or other open source projects (like openHAB, Domogik, DOG OSGi) will have their share on the market. Don't forget that Android@Home is just another proprietary technology that will work only with Android devices and domotics hardware from several companies. What if you want to use 1-wire sensors or you want to control your old TV with IR, or your AC with IR? Or you want to use your iPad or Windows 7 tablet as HA interface? This is where softwares like OpenRemote are strong, because they combine several different technologies and build unified logic and interfaces above them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Quite right. </p>

<p>Historically, some level of consolidation has always been beneficial to Open Source. Whether it was ad hoc (Linux vs UNIX, MySQL vs proprietary RDBMS) or systematic (large standardization efforts, Java Enterprise Edition was closest to me), it was successfully exploited by those who found business models to monetize a commoditized infrastructure (Red Hat Inc, MySQL AB, JBoss Inc.).</p>

<p>Technology will keep pushing forward, as it should. The bigger nut to crack is on the business side. Going after another proprietary business model in HA would lead to nowhere. There's a huge need to come up with some minimal, common base in the HA field. Immediately it means some gateway hardware and transport protocols. What business models emerge once the bar has been raised a little higher is the most interesting part to watch from here on.</p>

<p>I tell you all this because I think this is not the target of OpenRemote and the other open source HA projects. In most cases you go to a company that will install you a Gira KNX stuff for example, and you will use Gira's fancy touch UI for several K Euro</p></blockquote>

<p>Correct. The idea is to enable the pro-sumer to create their own installs, if they are inclined to do so. So, no it won't be mandatory to pay for a dealership or training in order to program your own house.</p>

<p>It is also obvious that doing such a programming is not necessarily for everyone (programming VCR, anyone?) even if we want to make self-service as easy as possible. So the space for services business still remains. But it will be less locked-down and that could be disruptive &#8211; not to mention that if HA does ever break into mainstream, a new approach will be necessary regardless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course there is the crappy X10, Insteon in the USA, HomeMatic/FS20 in Germany and Z-Wave (in Europe, mainly in Germany) and some other technologies that are relatively cheap and relatively easy for install by hobbyists and enthusiasts. I think this is the target of OpenRemote and the other open source projects.</p></blockquote>

<p>No <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>We don't want to be crappy <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>The target is to make professional installs possible, using an open platform.</p>

<p>We can't do much about the hardware (X10, Insteon, et al) so we just need to live with what is out there &#8211; another reason to hope Google would bring something good and affordable to the scene.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I tell all this just to clarify that there are two groups of people - "technical enthusiasts" and "regular (dumb) users". The first group of people is very small and the second group will never hear about OpenRemote</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't care if the second group is not familiar with OpenRemote (the mass will not tweak their own homes) but I certainly do care that they are <b>using</b> OpenRemote! <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Yes there are two markets, one is the technical DIY crowd that is now locked out because they can't install and program anything without a significant cost &#8211; you need to pay to get access to the tools and information to do such programming. Does that cost make sense if you're only interested in it for the sake of your own house, not as a dealership / integrator business you want to start? (No.)</p>

<p>The mass market is the mass market and in the end they don't care (don't have the time and inclination) beyond consumer electronics products what runs their system anymore than they care who made their WiFi router. They will continue to be serviced by installers and integrators.

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>There have been at least four attempts to implement 6lowpan in Linux. I have the email addresses of the people that have tried. There is one attempt currently on-going in Canada. There was also a bid from a company in Boston to CELF last year to do the work for somewhere in the $200K range. CELF didn't fund it.</p>

<p>All of the hobbyists fail when it gets to part of interoperability testing and tracking the evolving standards. They also don't implement any of the corner cases or things like encryption. You have to have encryption support to stop two nets in neighbor's houses from meshing into each other. It doesn't make sense to use any of the old attempts, they are all based on older versions of 6lowpan. It is better to report the 6lowpan implementation from Contiki again since is it more or less up to date.</p>

<p>None of the commercial entities are doing anything because they are all still stuck on Zigbee 1.0. Siemens was actively pursuing Linux kernel support for a while until they discovered that Zigbee is not GPL compatible and switched to a user space implementation. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/linux-zigbee/">http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/linux-zigbee/</a></p>

<p>6lowpan will win simply because the battle was fought thirty years ago and TCP/IP has already won. Anything besides TCP/IP is a proprietary solution. Cisco is a major supporter of the 6lowpan standardization effort. They are basically funding the whole thing.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I was disappointed that CELF wouldn't fund the Boston company. Once 6lowpan is in the kernel every Wifi router coming out of China will add support for it since it only takes about $2.00 worth of chips and you can raise the price of the router more than $2.00. These Chinese companies will immediately use the Linux code but they are never going to write it themselves.</p>

<p>Getting 6lowpan over 802.15.4 into millions of routers would solve major problems with bridging in the home automation world.</p>

<p>Tiny example... I have a small PCB on my desk with a 6lowpan/802.15.4 radio and an HDMI jack. It is capable of controlling most recent AV equipment using HDMI CEC signalling over the HDMI cable. These PCBs can be made for under $10 but there is no simple way to talk to them. It is cost prohibitive to directly implement Wifi in a device like this.  Your iPhone could send out a wifi signal which would go over a router with a 802.15.4 bridge in it.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hi Alexis,</p>

<p>Yes you are right. We are using Oracle Embedded in some cases. But the fees are no fun. If I had to guess, that's one reason Dalvik VM is getting adopted so quickly over the Oracle Embedded. And because of Oracle Embedded business model, Snoracle does not seem to be putting resources behind ZeroVM and Shark JIT on ARM either. Resources they would deserve. A real shame.</p>

<p>Java does have its attractions indeed, namely the massive amount of Open Source code that is out there ready to be used.</p>
