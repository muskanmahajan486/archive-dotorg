				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm primarily a windows user and know zip about Linux. <br/>
My effort with OpenRemote so far has been with Win7 and Android phones. So on the Win7 PC I have been running the OpenRemote software and using my Android phone to talk to the Win7 PC.</p>

<p>I do have some panStamp gear that I'm trying to get working and to that end I have bought a Raspberry Pi and attempting to use it and the required linux image to talk to my panStamp gear.</p>

<p>So the question is - Can two copies of OpenRemote controller exist on the one network and interact with each other?<br/>
Ie A panStamp input triggers a state change on the Raspberry Pi, that is then passed to the OpenRemote on the Win7 PC that then sends a command to the X10 interface to turn on a X10 light.</p>

<p>Perhaps a master/slave or a Proxy?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Neil.</p>
