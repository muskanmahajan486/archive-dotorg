				    <p>Hi,<br/>
I've planned to add support to my home-maid automation software. <br/>
To describe it in some words : a suite of python programs using mqtt. All the background (such as polling, configuration) is already done over mqtt.<br/>
For example, to "push" on a switch, I "speak" to a python server over mqtt. This one light on the push and return it's state over mqtt.<br/>
Sensors send their state over mqtt when it's needed but they can also be "called".</p>

<p>As openremote does not support mqtt directly, I was thinking of a kind of gateway.<br/>
My first thought was using http to achieve this ... but after looking at docs and browsing the forums, I'm not sure it's the best way to achieve this.<br/>
Maybe telnet / udp listener should be a better choice ?<br/>
Maybe another ...<br/>
So what "your" best way to do it guys?<br/>
Have you some docs or links about that</p>
