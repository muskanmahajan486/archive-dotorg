				    <p>Hello,<br/>
I'd like to say I am completely new to OR and find your software to be great thus far. However I have run into a problem I have already spent hours on with no progress in sight. I am using OR in conjunction with Open Source Automation and EventGhost all being on the same machine. I have no problem communicating with Open Source Automation via HTTP commands from OR. The problem I am having is communicating with EventGhost. I am assuming one uses a TCP/IP command in OR to achieve this. But I can't get OR to send a event to EventGhost.</p>

<p>If possible could someone explain to me how to one, send a command to EventGhost, and two, explain what I need to do to EventGhost to configure it to receive these commands. I am somewhat of a novice when it comes to I.T., so please be basic in your explanation. Thank you very much in advance for any help you may be.</p>

<p>Ron </p>
