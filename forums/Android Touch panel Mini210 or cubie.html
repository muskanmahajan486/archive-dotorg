				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>well, I was looking for home automation, opensource, and found openremote.</p>

<p>I'm planing my next house, and as I was looking for touch panels, I thought about using Mini210: <a href="http://www.friendlyarm.net/products/mini210s">Mini 210 specs</a> or cubieboard <a href="http://cubieboard.org/">Cubie site</a></p>

<p>Building a box for those is not too easy but with 3D printers it's a dream becoming reality at not to high prices.</p>

<p>I already used mini2440 in other projects, programming in Qt ( 1-wire based data logger in modbus), and I also programmed some stuff for Android, and more for iOS<br/>
So I'll be ready to play a bit <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>My goal is to have a few of those touch screens in the house, mostly in the kitchen, living room and my wife's office at home.<br/>
And those touch screens should be able to:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>act like interphone when needed</li>
	<li>play locally music for the nas ( mainly kitchen and office )</li>
	<li>show a video of the front camera door when someone rings at the door</li>
	<li>show CID when the phone rings and why not answer sip call ?</li>
</ul>


<p>and of course, command xbmcs for the different TVs, control lights and HVAC</p>

<p>In absolute everything is doable... but in real world this may differ a bit !</p>

<p>I did not go deep into openremote docs and architecture, that's why I'm asking here.</p>

<p>Let's put appart technical matters like video streaming for door bell as example, is openremote able to send events to remotes, or are remotes polling status from server ?<br/>
I'd like to try to add video stream and audio play into remotes apps for touch screens.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Cedric</p>

<p>Welcome to OpenRemote!</p>

<p>The current architecture relies on a HTTP REST API for communication between the consoles (remotes as you refer to them) and the central controller; this ultimately means that the consoles are polling the controller but there is some trickery involved in that the consoles will request a sensor to be polled and the controller will not send a response unless the sensor value changes, this is a way of achieving push like functionality using HTTP.</p>

<p>SIP functionality has been done in OR at some point but I was not involved and I haven't seen any of that so cannot comment on how it functions (search on the forums or look in the code base).</p>

<p>One of the joys of OpenRemote is that it is opensource so if there's some functionality you need/want and you're happy coding in JAVA then you can extend as much as you like.</p>
