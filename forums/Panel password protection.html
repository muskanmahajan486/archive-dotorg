				    <p>I see that I can have different panels for different devices in openremote. I want to create panels with covering different areas of the house with some kind of password authentication. The purpose is so the one user can have access to a panel that has UI to control all devices in the house. Whereas some users have access to panels that have only access to devices in certain areas. I see that this can be done. But I want to have password protection so that limited access users do not have access to panels that were not intended for their use.</p>

<p>For example I am the main user or admin for the house, I create a panel with control to all devices in the house. There may be children or guests for whom I will design separate panels and provide them individual user name and passwords that allows them access only to panels designed for there use. This way I can restrict sub users from playing havoc by remotely controlling every device in the house.</p>

<p>By the way I admire your work on the russound integration, do you connect your russound zone amplifier to the computer using RS232? Can you throw more light on the Physical setup since I am planning to buy a russound CA66. By the Way IPAS a German company has KNX to RS232 interface that they claim supports russound directly on KNX. I have one of this that I purchased but am yet to put it to use.</p></font>

The Russound integration is done using a Korenix Jetport 5201 connected via RS232 (a Moxa should do it too)</p>

<p>I just sold my CA66 and got myself a MCA-C5 which also support RIO protocol via ethernet and I want to look at that too.<br/>
We would not need the extra RS232_IP converter anymore.</p>

<p>I know of a similar device (or maybe even the same) sold from mediacraft which is the european distributor of Russound. It's quite expensive though and with OpenRemote you can also use your X10 or Z-Wave switche and not only KNX <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Where are you located? For german customers I am also a Russound dealer.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Thank you again for taking the time to reply.</p>

<p>I tend to prefer Global cache GC-100 6 instead of Korenix Jetport 5201 since I would have additional ir ports as well as emitters and one blaster bundled around for the same price of Korenix. In a larger installation for about double this cost I get a Global Cache GC-100 12 that has 2 - RS232 ports 6 ir ports along with 3 contact closure relays. Disclaimer : I have never used Korenix Jetport.</p>

<p>I was wondering why you had to go for the RS232 implementation when RIO protocol via ethernet would be optimal.</p>

<p>I am located in India, I have been exploring Nuvo, Sonos &amp; Russound for zone implementation. I would love to look at options of sourcing my Russound equipment from you. I source most of my KNX equipment by dealing directly with manufacturer who gives me fabulous pricing.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hear about the security feature soon. <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>By the time I started with OpenRemote and Russound the new RIO based devices were not out yet and I was able to get a cheap CAA-66 which I have sold a few week ago and I also have the new MCA-C5. Implementing RIO is for sure on my Todo-List since you can also control the Russound player and receive meta information.</p>

<p>Selling to India would be out of the reach of my small company. To much problems with taxes <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>I started to look at the security configuration yesterday and realized that there seems to be a bug in the iOS code <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
We will look into that and as soon as the How-To is done, I will let you know.</p></font>

<p>How much did u sell ur CA66 for? I would'nt mind picking a used one. If someone can pick it up for me in Germany what would it cost?</p>
