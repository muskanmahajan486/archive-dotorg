				    <p>I had an old Droid X just laying around since I upgraded.  I was able to turn it into a webcam which came in handy a few times.  I was wondering if anyone has tried to install openremote on a smartphone yet.  Right now I keep my computer on 24/7 for work so its not so bad.  Since I got a tablet, I really don't use it at all.  It just runs a few applications and that is it.  </p>

<p>I only have one controller right now and it is a CIA Webcontrol board.  Since everything I do is network based, I was thinking it might be cool to set up openremote on an old smartphone.  I was also thinking about putting it on a ARM like raspberry pi, but I don't have one yet. </p>

<p>I did some checking and found I-Jetty. I-Jetty can do console web apps.  Has anyone tired this idea yet?  </p>

<p>Edit:  Tried and failed.  Moving on.</p>

It's doable but requires a few tweaks here and there.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I figured it is possible but I don't have much time either.  I turned my old Droid X into a webcam instead.  The idea of using a device which does not use much power is very appealing to me.  I set up a system for my father that is running on a asus eeepc.  It doesn't use much power and it has it's own battery backup.  I do like the raspberry pi device but I can't seem to get my hands on one.  There are other embedded systems out there, but most are expensive.  </p>

<p>If anyone can think of a cheap(er) device that can run openremote and doesn't use much power, let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
