				    <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I have recently discovered openremote. <br/>
As I do have a Synology DS713+ and like to use things to the fullest it has been a long wish to get some home automation system running on my NAS.<br/>
Installing openremote is simple, and I get around with setting up things and building the app.<br/>
Together with that I have a RFXcom transreceiver and a bunch of klikaan klikuit switches (build in and plug in dimmers and switches for light)<br/>
Maybe I have not searched enough yet, but I thought to be able to find a bit more simple tutorials in head lines how to get a few things working.<br/>
So at this moment I feel like being stuck a little.<br/>
1, is there any info on how and if it is possible to get openremote communicating a RFXcom transreceiver on synology<br/>
2, do I need any additional software to get things working ( I get the impression by some things I read )<br/>
3, klik aan klik uit (dutch brand but commmon main stream switches) what protcol should I use to talk to it<br/>
4, how to identify within openremote a switch or dimmer out in the house (I can't figure an ID from it by looking at it?<br/>
In short, quite some missing information for me.<br/>
I do understand quite a bit of software and communication between things, but I am no programmer and I don't want to become one to get something working.<br/>
Maybe time is not right yet, things start to pop up for NAS servers, but a proper pre designed package is not available yet I reckon.<br/>
I am basically looking for a free configurable package/software which runs on a Synology NAS (DS713+)<br/>
Configuring would be nice, and give the ability to customize but at the same time allow a lot of freedom to make it to my own liking..</p>

<p>if anyone would be able to lift my understanding to the next level, I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Greetz Alexander </p>
