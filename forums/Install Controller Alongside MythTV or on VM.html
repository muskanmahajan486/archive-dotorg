				    <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I'm a newbie to the OpenRemote community and am excited to get started with it.  I'm building a box for a MythTV backend, which will be stowed away in my basement.  I'm planning on putting OR Controller on the same physical box, but I was wondering which option is optimal:<br/>
-Install Controller alongside MythTV on the same OS.  As a note, I'll be installing MythBuntu, so it essentially has Ubuntu as the OS.<br/>
-Use VirtualBox and create two separate VM's, one for the MythBuntu installation and one for another Ubuntu installation on which I'll place the OR Controller.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Well the Controller is all Java and runs on Tomcat. It is a very light-weight application with todays standards. </p>

<p>MythTV uses everything but (not) Java. </p>

<p>They will not interfere with each other. </p>

<p>In installing on separate VM's I suppose you are out for one of two things. </p>

<p>First. You want to avoid having to resolve complex dependencies. However for the controller it does not have complex dependencies since it depends solely on the JRE, and perhaps LIRC if you choose to use it. </p>

<p>Second you want to avoid having to repeat a complex configuration and setup in order to migrate, say to a new machine. Now the thing is that the Controller holds it's entire configuration in on single zip-file. You maintain this config in the Designer tool. Installing the Controller is as easy as dropping the Controller war in the Tomcat webapps dir and then you upload your config to the Controller webapp after it have started. How is that a bigger effort than deploying your VM image on a new machine? In a way the Controller make use of the fact that Java comes with it's own VM that provides a standard environment. </p>

<p>MythTV is a different beast. It have plenty of different dependencies and it takes plenty of configuration to get it running. Here I would see a good point in starting with a dedicated MythTV distribution such as Mythbuntu to spare yourself some of the hassle. </p></font>
