				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>A while ago I planned to use open remote for my home automation project.<br/>
However somebody convinced me to go for a Vera unit, which I now think was a big mistake...</p>

<p>I bought a vera2 and some z-wave devices.<br/>
It was working well, but now I am close to 45 devices and the unit becomes unresponsive... <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>My questions:<br/>
Would it be a solution to go to a raspberry pi with the Z-Wave plug?<br/>
Would it be possible to run the open remote controller on the same raspberry?<br/>
Would it be possible to run xbmc on the same raspberry?</p>

<p>FYI:<br/>
I run:<br/>
11 Vision Security Door/Window sensor<br/>
12 Phillio Tech 2x1,5kw relay switches<br/>
15 Popp Plugs<br/>
4 Phillio Tech Shutter modules<br/>
2 Vision Security CO sensors<br/>
2 Vision Security Smoke sensors</p>

<p>you think the total will be too much.<br/>
Installing And my Z-wave devices AND OpenRemote AND xbmc, or even the amount of Z-wave devices will be too much for the raZberry?</p>

<p>I am considering to buy a second raspberry to run both OpenRemote and XBMC, thus the raZberry only would need to take care of the Z-Wave handling.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
Dieter</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I think the developers of RaZberry do consider your installation of some 45 devices as too much for RaZberry. To be sure you must ask them directly.<br/>
They are working on a complete re-implementation of the Z-Way core from python into Google V8 JS. That may give improvement, but they have not yet indicated how much. They say the version 2.0 will be released in a mont from now or so. On past experience I would reckon on november-december for a usable release.</p>

<p>That being said about RaZberry proper. If you want to interface with OpenRemote, you now can use their <b>OpenRemoteHelpers</b> module for issuing commands and retrieving statusses. The status reading is the problem part. In order to get a decent feedback on your console, you must do quite frequent polling. For switches in the order of 2-3 seconds. For sliders even more frequent. That is heavy on the Raspberry side. In principle you can bind RaZberry events to be pushed to OpenRemote, but in contrast to <b>commands</b> you can not push a <b>status</b> through the REST API of OpenRemote. Too many status requests from polling by OpenRemote seems to clog the Z-Wave network. In my case that has lead to irreparable crashes of the Pi.<br/>
I have no solution yet.</p></font>

So I hope on that aspect I am safe.</p>

<p>In My humble opinion thats not really correct.<br/>
The Company I work, a worldwide active Company, is using raspberry's already for years to operate high sensitive sensors, etc... in an industrial field where there is dust, humidity,...</p>

<p>also, i understand from your site that you are also still run a razberry (thus raspberry pi)</p></font>
