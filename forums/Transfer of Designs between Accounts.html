				    <p>Hi noble community.</p>

<p>For reasons associated with trying to get my designer files working on a OR Controller on a Raspberry Pi, I believe I have come to the conclusion that I need to slim down my Designer files. I have four different panels set up in my account (iPhone, iPad, and two Custom Android (one 7" and one 10"). In each panel I have about 6 screens. Each screen shares from a list of about 10 devices (TV's, HTPC, an Extron AV Switch, LightwaveRF lighting controls and so forth).</p>

<p>So, if I want to slim down my Designer Files to get them to work on a Pi, I know I can create a new account and I can import my panel screens from Public Templates.</p>

<p>BUT.... using Public Templates does not bring across the Devices and I lose my Commands.</p>

<p>So it looks like I will have to re-enter all of my Devices and Commands and import across to a new OR Account the public templates....</p>

<p>Surely there has to be a better way? Am I staring it in the face?</p>

<p>thanks in advance...</p>

<p>Unfortunately for now you will need to re-enter the device data.</p>

<p>However for your tests on rasperry the device data is probably not relevant and you can try first if the panel size is the issue.</p></font>
