				    <p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>I've just started play with OR and am very impressed with the speed at which I've been able to put together something which works (but I need to make it look pretty now!).  I've written a simple webserver to interface between OR and xAP which my home automation system (IdraTEK) supports. Although I'm pretty sure my little server brakes all the standards for webservers and xAP it seems to work well.  My problem is that now I need to crease a whole load of commands for the all the xAP enpoints in my system (potentially 3 or 4 per endpoint).</p>

<p>I'm happy writing a bit of python to generate a controller.xml file (or even a portion of it) and then paste it all together, but I presume that I can't then get that back into the designer to be able to use the commands when creating a new panel. Have I missed something or am I going about this the wrong way?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Peter.</p>

There are a few protocols (Z-Wave) that have the ability to read and import devices and to automatically construct commands and sensors. I don't know if those (Z-Wave) modules are in the public repositories, because it is based on a At this moment Designer can not import contoller.xml. Work is underway to support this. I have seen and tested a alpha version of the "paid for" PRO designer that works fine for my design. I have no information if it and when it will appear in the free designer. </p></font>

<p>The current version of the export/import feature Pieter is referring to will not be the ideal candidate for this either, because of the format used for the export files.</p>

<p>The 2 best options I would see are:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>if you (or somebody else) would like to contribute, implement a xAP import wizard in the designer (much like the KNX ETS import that exists). In the short term for you, it would imply running a local designer (at least while developing the wizard).</li>
	<li>in the longer term, there will be a public REST API to allow creation of devices, commands, ... You can then script this API to create your required objects. It's on the roadmap but we have no timeframe for it (given current workload, I would say not soon <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> )</li>

<p>I'll take a look.  I suspect my Java isn't up to it...  I'm not sure I'll even be able to build a local copy of the designer!</p></font>
