				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Over the last weeks or so I am getting ,ore and more often the above message. Only can select OK or Settings. </p>

<p>However, the wifi net is ok in my house, to a point where I do not have any other problems with my network.</p>

<p>Did anyone have similar problems? Seems like the server is on holiday for a while. </p>

<p>I am using a KNX client on my iPhone, and connect to ORB running on Ubuntu 10.4.</p>

<p>Rick</p>

<p>Or do you need to restart the controller?</p>

<p>If it's the first, then that would indicate some issue with connection timeouts, broken connections, or similar.</p>

After starting the Openremote client it tells me that there is no server available and it will use cached content. However, everything works. The reason appears to be that the timeout is to short as it looks for the ORB. The ORB is only visible over WiFi and it takes too long for WiFi to start or the timeout in Openremote is too short depending on how you look at it. The workaround is to trigger WiFi to start before Openremote, but it is not ideal of course. I guess I should file a bug for it. </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Juha,</p>

<p>It is while using it. Sometimes the connection drops or the server is at least not responsive, as it seems. When I page from page to page, sometimes the KNX commands do not return the status, so the buttons and the text on my screen does not update. Then after 5 to 10 seconds I get a server timeout with the message above.</p>

<p>When I click settings, then it gets the server and it works for maybe 20 to 30 seconds. Then after a while it again starts given the message above.</p>

<p>Not sure whether it has something to do with my programming or whether it is something I can track in the server logs? Or would it be the client?</p>

<p>Grateful for any advise.<br/>
Rick </p></font>
