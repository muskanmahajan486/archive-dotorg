				    <p>Has somebody configured sensors for a Netatmo Weather Station?</p>

<p>I alrady have a Netatmo Wifi Weather Station that provides inside and outside temperature and humidity data, among other data. The station uploads de current values to the cloud every 5 minutes, and provides an API to access all these values through http.</p>

<p>I want to define some senors that provide the current temperatures from Neatmo Weather Station, to control a heater and to automate some blinds by taking into account temperatures inside and outide.</p>

<p>So far I have been able to read temperature and humidity through a sensor using http proocol, but it has been by using an access token, that I have got manually and that only lasts for 3 hours. </p>

<p>By the way, I was unable to filter the response through Json, and I ended up doing it through a regular expression, although it took to me a lot of time to figure out how openremote applies regular expressions...</p>

<p>Now I need to fully automate it. I need to get the token automatically, and then to maintain it active by refreshing it automatically before the 3h period expires. Although I have very limited knowledge, I can try to come up with a solution, but first I wanted to check if somebody has already done it.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Alex</p>

Did you finally succeed to make it work? I am about to try to do the same, so I would be glad to take benefit of what you've done.</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Mat,</p>

<p>I found a library in Python to easily access any data from the Netatmo Weather Station. You can find it here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/philippelt/netatmo-api-python/blob/master/lnetatmo.py">https://github.com/philippelt/netatmo-api-python/blob/master/lnetatmo.py</a></p>

<p>I have written another python script that uses this library to get the data that I am interested in (interior and exterior temperature)</p>

<p>Then I have defined a command that uses shell execution protocol to call the above script and feed the result into a sensor (every 15 minutes).</p>

<p>At this point I am just displaying the string returned by the python script,  through the sensor, in the OR mobile App.</p>

<p>Eventually I want to get the two values returned by a single command into different sensors, to use this information in a rule. I have read some post that explains how to do it, but so far I have not been able to make it work.</p>

<p>Hope it helps,<br/>
Alex</p>
