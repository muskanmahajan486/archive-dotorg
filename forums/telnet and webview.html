The telnet command does close the session after each command. Nothing can be done unless the command is rewritten.<br/>
The webview is refreshed based on a status sensor. You will need a virtual command that via rule or something changes the URL for webview eg. add a number or timestamp to URL.</p></font>

I'm sorry if I post in the wrong place.<br/>
there is a tutorial on the control of a Denon amp but this does not react in the same way. with putty I am obliged to close the telnet connection and reopen to send a second command (the server gives an answer and do not call me the next line) with OpenRemote I have sent two successive commands (the first and rejects me 2nd is taken into account). I need you because I really can not find the solution. or do I make changes to webview?</p></font>
