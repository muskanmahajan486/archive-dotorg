				    <p>Hi<br/>
I'm new to OR so I might have missed something...<br/>
I have managed to set up the Console on my Iphone 4.<br/>
I can switch on and off some lights at my house <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/><br/>
But only when I'm on Wi-Fi.<br/>
I can control the lights at home from my office when I'm connected to the company Wi-Fi network.<br/>
So my network and firewall/router setup at home works fine.<br/>
But when I'm not connected to a Wi-Fi network only GPRS (3G, mobile network) I get this error message in the Console:<br/>
"Warning, Please connect your device to network. Using cached content".</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I was connected to the company Wi-Fi and it worked, then I moved away from the Wi-Fi network with the Console running. And then I could control my lights via the GPRS network. But when I restarted the Console the error message was there again.</p>

<p>Any clues?</p>

<p>/Andreas</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hmm not at the moment,</p>

<p>WiFi setup is the only one being tested at the moment, and quite possible it is making some (poor, from your point of view) assumptions about availability of WiFi network.</p>

<p>I can look into GPRS/3G at some point, especially keeping an eye on remote control outside the controller LAN (your use case) but will likely lead this effort from the Android console first.</p>

<p>Thanks for reporting though and letting us know your experiences with controlling across the public Internet. We've been too busy trying to get the basics done that we haven't really paid attention to this one yet.</p>

<p>From a non-Iphone app programmers point of view, it sounds like an easy fix.<br/>
No other app that I know of cares if the internet access is over Wi-Fi or GPRS.</p>

<p>Am unable to say anything further, whether there's an issue or not, as I've not tested. Just recall similar-looking assumptions being made in the Android client, so it may have been originated from the iOS client.</p>
