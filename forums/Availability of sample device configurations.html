				    <p>I have yet to move to OpenRemote from my Pronto, however, one thing that has added to my lack of initiative of moving to OR is that I have to start from scratch, and the online designer seems daunting to me. Barring something that imports configuration files, either .ccf or .xcf files one of the Pronto designers, one thing that made making a configuration for the various Pronto devices was the availability of device configurations from www.remotecentral.com. Being able to download a configuration file and modify it as necessary was a fantastic way, for me, to relatively quickly get a Pronto up and running.</p>

<p>So, I have two questions:</p>

<p>1. I know that there was an initiative to import either .ccf or .xcf files from the Pronto designers. Did this effort succeed?<br/>
2. If the answer to number 1 is no, is there a repository of configuration files for OpenRemote that could be used as a basis for a new configuration and are available to the public for download?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Matthew</p>
