				    <p>I am a non-technical app developer and looking into a new app project that based around some type of universal remote control.<br/>
I'm keen to take advantage of the infra-red blasters on a lot of the android models.  It is for TV sets primarily.<br/>
Am I able to embed OpenRemote into the app I am developing?  Is that how it works? Sorry I'm the non-technical part of the team but I will be hiring a person with the necessary technical skills once I have determined the best way forward.<br/>
The universal remote is one part of this app idea.  The other parts are more straight forward content sharing etc.<br/>
It is a novelty app.<br/>
Any feedback would be appreciated as I am jsut starting out and would hate to start building something only to find there is a roadblock.</p>
