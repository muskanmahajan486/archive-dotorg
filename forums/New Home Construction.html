				    <p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>We are in the process of building a new log home in the mountains of New Mexico, USA.  Recently, I have started looking into HA solutions and came across OpenRemote and really like what I have seen so far.  The plan is to wire the home for automation as much as is reasonable.  Initially, we will be living in the house part time, so we need to ability to control/monitor the home when we are not there.  We would like to start off with controlling/monitoring the following:</p>

<p>6 zone radiant heating with 6 thermostats<br/>
exterior security cameras<br/>
motion sensors<br/>
door and window sensors<br/>
lighting control<br/>
door lock/unlock</p>

<p>In the future, we will also look into controlling other systems including power, home communications, home theater, etc.</p>

<p>To simplify the integration with OpenRemote, I am looking for recommendations on equipment that is either already supported by OpenRemote or easily integrated.</p>

<p>Your suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Brian.</p>
