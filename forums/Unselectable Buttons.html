				    <p>Hi</p>

<p>I've designed a couple of panels (TV &amp; FREESAT) and seem to have a few 'lost' buttons on the Freesat panel. The situation occurred when I was adding buttons by dragging from the widget list but they failed to appear - didnt think anything of it and carried on. They first showed up on my wifes Galaxy S3 at the botton of the panel. I can remove them from panel.xml but everytime I sync they re-appear. The problem is I cant see them in Designer to remove them. 2 ideas; <br/>
a) can I upload panel.xml to OpenRemote and overwrite in Designer?<br/>
b) is there a way to 'select all' in Designer, deselect the good ones, and shift the hidden ones upwards until visible?</p>

I can't think of an easy way to get rid of those buttons right now.</p>

<p>Is the design in a custom panel ?<br/>
If so, maybe changing the size to be much bigger so buttons are revealed is an option.<br/>
There is however a couple of issues with edit of custom panel that might prevent that on the current designer version.<br/>
They will be fixed in Pro 1.0.12 (which is not yet released).</p></font>

The only edit option is the name of the panel. I shall have to bite the bullet and create a new panel. As usual, the amount of time I spent trying to figure how to avoid creating a replacement is enough time to create a replacement! I'm sure theres a name for that!</p></font>
