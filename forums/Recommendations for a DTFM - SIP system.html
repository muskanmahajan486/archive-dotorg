				    <p>Everything I've read about PBX systems seem to be geared for voice use (mailboxes, call forwarding, caller id, etc).   I haven't been able to find much in terms of using it for home automation.</p>

<p>I've got a VOIP adapter that I use with Google Voice / Gizmo5 for sending and receiving calls, but I'd like to setup a system such that I can call, and have an automated menu (dtfm touchtone control) that I can use to turn on and off things at home.</p>

<p>I understand X-10 is the big hardware player in town for this kind of stuff, but what else would I need?   Could a PBX like freeswitch, connect to an SIP account with Gizmo5 or SIP Sorcerer, and control X10 devices?    Is MisterHouse and Zoneminder just internet aware versions of FireCracker?</p>

<p>BTW, I'm not tied to having to use a PBX.. its just the only way I can think of...   are there other ways to do home automation that can be controlled thru a phone call?</p>

<p>You'll have to get into the Dial plan, I hacked together something similar a while back I basically ran php scripts depending on what number was pressed. If you can control the X10 hardware from system scripts it'd be possible to do this</p>

<p>The command I used was system, more info here:</p>
