				    <p>Hi everyone,<br/>
I've been a lurker here for a bit. I originally found this project when I was doing some research a few months ago about starting a HA business.<br/>
I'd love to get involved with this project.<br/>
I'm a Java developer with a strong interest in HA, but no experience using any of it. I have about 10 years experience developing apps, with the last 5 years or so being mostly Java. I did a lot of C early on. I've used/touched most of the major Java tools and frameworks (haven't used GWT, though). Lately, I've been doing mostly webapps &#45;&#45; a lot of Portal work. My current work project is a WebSphere Portal implementation with lots of jQuery mixed in.<br/>
Let me know what you need&#33; This is a very exciting project.<br/>
Greg</p>

<p>As soon as we have 1.0 out we'll have a lot to work on with the community, really looking forward to that.</p>

<p>In the mean time freel to have a peek at the code we have in SVN already</p>

<p><a href="http://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openremote/">http://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openremote/</a></p>

<p>Do you have any HA HW at home? Or planning on any? Where are you based?</p>


<p>Regards,</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello Greg,</p>

<p>Thanks for your offer to help. Java + C sounds like an ideal combination.</p>

<p>There are couple of ideas I think could be useful to start prototyping with. </p>

<h4><a name="I%27min-WebConsole"></a>Web Console</h4>

<p>One is the <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/Web+Console+Overview" title="Web Console Overview">web console</a>. While our initial 1.0 release targets iPhone as the panel ("remote"), there's a need for a generic web based (HTML+CSS+jQuery, GWT if necessary) console to be used with other devices, smart phones, touch screen netbooks, regular old PC's as the panels for OpenRemote system.</p>

<p>We are right now working on getting the very first controller on the ORB (we should call it "Skinny" cause the only thing it does is translate REST to LIRC irsend). It takes the simplest possible REST command which you can see <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/Controller+API+Documentation" title="Controller API Documentation">in the controller API documentation</a>. So basically just a POST from a button.</p>

<p>The button id is coming from the configuration file bundle that you can download from <a href="http://composer.openremote.org/demo">http://composer.openremote.org/demo</a>. If you peek inside this zip you'll see there's a controller.xml there which basically tells you what button IDs it expects and have mappings for. The button ID then maps to an event ID that can be infrared, x10 or knx which in turns maps to a specific command to those protocols.</p>

<p>In addition, you can look into the iphone.xml, it has some additional <b>layout</b> description on where the buttons go on iPhone layout. Whether this matters or not for the web console has yet to be seen.</p>

<p>So that's one idea. Basically a run-of-the-mill web app that hooks into the specific configuration files and REST API we are exposing in the OpenRemote system.</p>

<p>I suspect it needs a lot of details to be hashed out which is why I am suggesting it as a prototype &#8211; sort of to ensure the APIs we are developing take into account the specific requirements that a non-iPhone consoles might have and work through and evolve things as necessary to make things generic enough to support all additional panel development.</p>

<h4><a name="I%27min-TheBareMetalOption"></a>The Bare Metal Option</h4>

<p>If you fancy more the Work Of Real Men (just kidding), then I've been glancing through the libusb APIs a few weeks back for the inevitable need we will have to talk to USB devices from Java layers. Couple of options here, go through existing work on Java-USB API and see if there's anything there that has a valid Open Source license, deploys on Linux (Voyage and Ubuntu at least) and is of acceptable quality. Or just whip together a simple socket based C daemon with custom IP protocol and talk libusb API directly. There's plenty of lib and framework scaffolding for all the socket part, no need to reimplement the wheel, and libusb is pretty straight forward too, just needs the integration protocol to be defined (idea similar to AJP httpd - tomcat bridge). Should be pretty quick job either way.</p>

<p>Again, don't have a specific USB device yet that needs is Right Now (but X10 CM15A interface comes to mind very quickly) but would be cool to have somebody look into it in preparation (especially the CM15A part).</p>

<p>So just couple of quick ideas, I should move them to wiki and put some more meat around it but right now a bit busy getting code released. But maybe it can get something going. Would really love to see somebody to take a bit of a lead and organize efforts around these.</p>

<p>I'm based in Buffalo area / NY / US. Don't own any HA hardware yet, but I plan to down the road <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p>Juha, I'd love to help out with both things you mentioned. I downloaded everything from SVN. Let me take a look at that stuff, and I'll do some reading up on USB as well. Once I do that, if I think I'm capable of it, I'd love to take a bit of a lead on these things.</p>
