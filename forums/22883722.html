				    <p>Hi guys..</p>

<p>Have you been looking at joining with the IFTTT initiative??<br/>
I think it could be really cool to be able to control all the OpenRemote devices via Facebook or Twitter.</p>

<p>just imagine when I write an update on FB saying "Going home now" then my lights in the driveway turn on as well as the lights in the hallway and temperature is raised..</p>

<p>Have you had a look at this??</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
Fredrik</p>

<p>I already have this implemented, however without OpenRemote. The device I'm using is WIFE1.0 <img class="emoticon" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></font>

<p>I would be interested in taking a lead on this. The killer application for me is the SMS channel. Through IFTTT it is possible to send SMSs and what it is more important, this service is free of charge! For a place where I live, this is the only possibility to have free SMSs which I am aware off. All other services are paid and not very cheap.</p>

<p>I've already contacted them and asked what is needed for creating a channel. First we must fill the form <a href="https://ifttt.com/platform">https://ifttt.com/platform</a><br/>
I would need some help with filling it from the core team, especially about API. About triggers and actions perhaps the community can speak? Personally I think that we should have something like IFTTT facade available through rules. For actions there should be probably a new protocol made which would make it possible to create sensors triggered through IFTTT and therefore available in rules again.</p></font>

The question is, should the comparison be done by IFTTT or by OpenRemote (rules).</p>

<p>For action we need a way for IFTTT to trigger an OR command. The issue is how does IFTTT connect to our controller? <br/>
The user will have to open ports in his firewall which is not perfect.</p></font>

<p>Triggers: a trigger must be defined on IFTTT platform probably beforehand. Otherwise the web interface on ifttt.com would need to be dynamic and I don't think it is. I think that a generic iftttTrigger() method need to be available in rules taking one string parameter. This way it would be possible to pass this string to THEN on the ifttt.com.</p>

<p>Actions: I think that it is not IFTTT that calls Belkin's switch but rather that Belkin polls ifttt.com web site for an action. This is because the action can take up to 15mins to execute. Probably an action can be accessed through an http call? In any case, I haven't had to open any ports for my WeMo's. On the other hand they are connected with Belkin's cloud so perhaps WeMo's don't talk with the ifttt.com site at all, and all triggers/actions go through Belkin's cloud? </p></font>

Looks like the hue channel is using the myhue website to communicate with ifttt.<br/>
And then the myhue website is communicating with the hue bridge.</p>

<p>This would mean that for openremote we would have to use the proxy service from the openremote cloud to communicate with ifttt and with the controller.<br/>
For sensors we could have the controller contact ifttt directly.</p></font>

<p>Is this something which already exists or need to be built? Can you elaborate more?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>IMHO, the simplest would be to do it through rules. As all sensors are able to trigger rules it would be enough just to have the generic iftttTrigger(String param) and all types of sensors are done. Only one trigger in IFTTT but with all possibilities. Otherwise we can end up with many triggers like smartthings channel <a href="https://ifttt.com/smartthings">https://ifttt.com/smartthings</a>, which IMHO is a poor design decision. You have many trigger types but yet not able to do everything, like trigger only when device unlocked AND any new motion THEN. Taking into account that Openremote can define very large trigger conditions making one generic trigger on the IFTTT side make sense for me.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Having a universal 'IFTTSensor' at OR side as Trigger sounds like a logical idea. A rule could define how the sensor status is changed at OR side. For the action wouldn't it make sense to Action a universal 'IFFTscene' as well at OR side. This could trigger a macro (or sensor+rule?) in which we define the commands and values. This way we also keep the Action limited. </p>

<p>I guess IFTTT needs some Meta data for both triggers and actions, to give them a logical name in the App. Triggers could be "Sensor", Action could be "Scene". At our end we need to link it to a 'default' sensor and 'default' action. This is to safeguard that IFTTT will always link a working 'trigger' or 'action' at OR side. I wouldn't be suprised if that's one of the requirements IFTTT has.</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>As for triggers, IFTTT has two components: 'trigger fields' and 'trigger components'. For example a gmail trigger for e-mail from particular address has as 'trigger field' an e-mail address and as 'trigger components' FromAddress, Subject, BodyPlain, etc.<br/>
I think that we can define two OR triggers, one with empty 'trigger fields' and one with sensor name as 'trigger field'. As trigger components there will be sensor name, sensor Id, sensor value and sensor type. Sensor id and type would be helpful for applications like remote logging.</p>

<p>For action we would need one action type 'Scene'. For 'action fields' we would have sensor name and sensor value.</p>

<p>Is it OK to put it on the form?</p></font>

<p>i also tried \w ,+\w, \w , (?s)\w ,etc nothing works</p>

<p>and for sending commands, they do not trigger at all with the option from the book(i am not sure where to check the errors for this). I also tried with making a .bat file run the .ps1 files and so on, and from double click in Windows they work fine but from OR they do not run. (I have another .bat file for pc restart and it works)</p>

<p>Is there something I can do?</p>
