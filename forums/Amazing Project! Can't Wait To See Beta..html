				    <p>I just wanted to say i'm impressed. I can't wait to see the first release. Are you guys planning to create a midlet for those of us who aren't sporting iphones?&nbsp;My phone may be able to handle javascript but sending commands via bluetooth seems a bit easier&nbsp;for my ZN5.&nbsp;<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>I'm going to be adding some x10 control to my home made&nbsp;digital picture frame Running DSL and would love to try your software out. This would be both the panel and the interface to the controller after&nbsp;I add a touchscreen film. <br clear="all" /></p>

<p>If you need any help I may be able to do entry level stuff. I know a little python and ruby.</p>

<p>Good Luck&#33;</p>

<p>Thanks for the encouraging words. We will try to get a beta to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>No immediate plans for J2ME smart phones right this moment. However, always curious to hear what hardware people would like to utilize. Thanks for sharing that with us and we will keep it in mind.</p></font>
