				    <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>First, happy new year to everybody, and many thanks to all having developped this wonderfull project.<br/>
I discovered it recently, and I now try to make it work with a KNX installation.</p>

<p>The system is running well excepted that a switch won't toggle.</p>

<p>Let's describes the configuration :</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Well running KNX installation</li>
	<li>EIBd and openremote installed on a dedicated Linux debian server (via-epia based)</li>
	<li>Panel created for Android device</li>
</ul>


<p>The behavior is the next :</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>I created a panel with a KNX switch (tutorial followed):<br/>
  If the light is on before to start Android application : will turn off but, after, will never turn on again.<br/>
  If the light is off.... reverse.<br/>
When I track the KNX data from vbusmonitor, I can see that the same message (i.e. on, on and on again..) is sended to knx.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The label ( and the switch image ) follow the "on" or "off" status when the toggle come from the KNX bus, ie with groupswrite line command on the eibd server.<br/>
  This means that the status should be OK.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>If I create 2 separate buttons from "commands", I can switch on and off with the appropriate button, but in this case, the here above label doesn't follow the right status.</li>
</ul>


<p>Seems like that openremote couldn't write and listen (or take account) of his proper action.</p>

<p>Test of the panel with the "beehive.openrem..." return OK.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea ?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,<br/>
Philippe</p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>So, I found from myself...</p>

<p>The mistake was coming from the fact that I used the same KNX group address for the STATUS, instead of using a separate group address, linked with the feedback object of the KNX_physical device in ETS.</p>

<p>My mistake was based on the tutorial <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+KNX+Switches">http://www.openremote.org/display/docs/OpenRemote+2.0+How+To+-+KNX+Switches</a>, where this is showed like that (same group address), what is wrong in this case.</p>

<p>Let's now go to the next steps...</p></font>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>So I am trying the same thing... But i wonder, is it a must to have the status on a separate group address? In my KNX installation there is no separate group address for status and when i use KNXdroid on my phone it works nice , I can toggle the switch and status follows. And if I change status using the switch on the wall status changes in KNXdroid. In the panel i created and using on an Ipad the status will follow when using the switch on the wall but using the Ipad I can only switch on or off depending previous status and if I turn on/off the switch the status in the panel don't change. What to do? </p>

                                    <font class="smallfont"><p>I didn't write the openremote application... But with what I have seen, it seems to me that it's a must have in this case. It is very possible that any other application such KNXDroid (wich I don't know at all) is written by another way and work without any separate object.</p>

<p>You can always add in your installation a separate group for the feedback message via the ETS programm.<br/>
You should affect the feedback object of your device to this group. On some KNX devices, you need to activate these feedback objects in the parameters section.</p>

<p>If you can't find it, tell me what KNX device you have, and I will try to find it for you.</p>

<p>Okey, so I need to make a change in the programming of my KNX-system. That's a bit bad for me since I don't have any ETS4... Well I guess i have to contact my electrician and see if he can help me with that.</p></font>
