				    <p>Hi everybody,</p>

<p>first of all let me congratulate everybody for their great work. I am a software developer, so over time I will probably contribute to it's development.</p>

<p>I am also a home automation enthusiast who would like to use OpenRemote in his own home. In my solution, everything is custom and built around a BeagleBone Black controller. I have custom hardware that connects via SPI to the BBB in a centralized point from which long wires go through the house (let's remember wires are the cheapest part in any home automation solution). OpenRemote is used as a remote over UDP and UDPListener protocols to control my custom python driver.</p>

<p>At the moment I have already corrected and enhanced the UDPListener so that it accepts multiple sensors with the same regex. The problem is that I am lost in the sources. I can't seem to figure out which is the real trunk folder... the folder where all development is merged for a release. From what I can tell there is not one trunk with multiple branches for feature development, but multiple trunks ???</p>

<p>Hope the forum is active and somebody can help me. </p>

<p>PS: Is there a schedule for the next release ? I would like to know so that I could send my changes to the responsible person</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br/>
Lucian</p>

I have already did that, but in my case I would go with UDP + UDPListener with some enhancements. </p></font>
