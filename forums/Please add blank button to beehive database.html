				    <p>I have been playing around with the OpenRemote designer. There is a nice set of buttons in there, but there are some buttons that are not available. Could you add a blank button, so that I could just put a label on it or export it to Gimp and customize it? </p>

<p>Another comment is that there is a feature OR designer called "New Screen from Template", which has user contributed content. Some of these screens are very good and useful. But many are garbage and it takes a long time to sort through these. Maybe you could add a rating scale, and the highest rated screens would show up first in a search. You could also add a "flag for removal" button.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
