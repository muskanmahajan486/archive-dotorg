				    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience working with the rules engine and setting the value of sensors. </p>

<p>I have a sensor called "Power" and the only way I've found to set the value of the sensor has been to create a command called "setPower" and link it to the sensor; then call:</p>

<p> execute.command("setPower",200); </p>

<p>This seems clunky as the reading about the engine it seems to imply that I could get/set values from the sensor without having to do this?</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is, grab a chunk of XML using the HTTP command and then use the rules engine to parse the XML when it changes and extract the sensor values and set each sensor accordingly. I have to do this because I'm using the Plugwise lighting control system which I can only talk to over HTTP (without writing a serial driver) and I don't want to issue an HTTP command for each light to get it's status, I just want to pull the whole lot in one go.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ian</p>
