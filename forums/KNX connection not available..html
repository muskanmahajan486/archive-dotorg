				    <p>Hi,<br/>
Trying to get this to work but it doesn't seems like I am able to get the KNX connection up and running. <br/>
Here is what I have done. <br/>
I have a Siemens 148N/22 ip interface.<br/>
I have not configured anything just starting openremote run. <br/>
I have tomcat installed but have not configured anything there.  <br/>
I have setup a controller/ re-used an old one I created ages ago and created a new basic one.<br/>
I have ETS3 up and running and sees the ip interface and can read the bus, this is however switched off when I am trying to use openremote.<br/>
Running on win7 and got the ip interface behind a bbox2 modem/router. It must be some config I am missing as I have managed to get this working on the same stuff about 2 years ago. Any suggestions any one.</p>

<p>Cheers<br/>
David J</p>

Put another router behind the bbox and it works smoothly. So this can be closed, but it might help some other people in Belgium connected via a bbox.</p>

<p>Cheers<br/>
