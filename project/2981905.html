				    <p>OpenRemote 1.0 <b>Milestone 2</b> is a developer release which includes an end-to-end infrared implementation. All the components to run an user interface on an iPhone or iPod Touch and a controller to translate HTTP requests to infrared (LIRC) codes are included. </p>

<p>The included functionality is demonstrated on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFDB5ao2v0">Infrared Demo Video</a> and <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~jlvh/2009/04/23/It+works%21" title="It works!">It works&#33;</a> blog. <b>Milestone 2</b> extends the functionality shown in these videos with a more customizable user interface. You can see examples of types of user interfaces that can be created with <b>M2</b> in <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~juha/2009/05/31/New+iPhone+Console+Screenshots%21" title="New iPhone Console Screenshots!">this blog entry</a>.</p>

<p>Milestone 2 has been deployed and is available online at <a href="http://composer.openremote.org/1.0/M2">http://composer.openremote.org/1.0/M2</a> for demo purposes. </p>

<p>New features include:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Ability to create multiple screens in iPhone user interface layout</li>
	<li>Grid size in the iPhone UI layout can be altered</li>
	<li>Button size can be altered to span multiple rows or columns in the grid</li>
	<li>Button labels can be altered from their defaults or translated to other languages</li>
	<li>Button labels can be replaced by icon images</li>
	<li>Default icon theme can be configured for the UI Composer</li>
	<li>Custom user icons and images can be uploaded to the iPhone console layout</li>
	<li>Macros can be nested</li>
</ul>


<p>For more details on the above features, see What is new compared to OpenRemote 1.0 Milestone 1\?.</p>



<p>To deploy OpenRemote 1.0 Milestone 2 you will need a Linux-based computer with Java VM, Tomcat and LIRC installed. We've tested M2 with <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/Infrared+Hardware">CommandIR II</a> infrared transmitter. Other LIRC compatible IR transmitters may also work but we can't make any guarantees at this point. The hardware/operating system/infrared combination we've tested M2 with is ALIX/Voyage/CommandIR (see <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/OpenRemote+Reference+Implementation+-+Hardware+Bill+of+Materials" title="OpenRemote Reference Implementation - Hardware Bill of Materials">OpenRemote RI</a>). </p>




<h4><a name="WhatisincludedinOpenRemote1.0Milestone2%3F-Whatisnotincluded"></a>What is not included </h4>

<p>OpenRemote 1.0 <b>Milestone 2</b> does <b>not</b> include any other protocol functionality. While the UI composer does show tabs for generating events to other protocols such as KNX, X10, Telnet and HTTP, these features have not yet been merged to the milestone branch. In the meanwhile developers can review these features in <a href="http://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openremote/branches/feature/KNXControllerEvent">KNXControllerEvent</a> and <a href="http://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openremote/branches/feature/TCP-HTTP-TelnetEvents-mredeker">TCP-HTTP-TelnetEvents</a> feature branches. Both these branches have been updated to M2 revisions, and will be included in the next M3 release.</p>
