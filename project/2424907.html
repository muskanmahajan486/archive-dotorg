<p>OpenRemote 1.0 Milestone 1 is a developer release which includes an end-to-end infrared implementation. All the components to run an user interface on an iPhone or iPod Touch and a controller to translate HTTP requests to infrared (LIRC) codes are included.</p>

<p>The included functionality is demonstrated on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYFDB5ao2v0">Infrared Demo Video</a> and <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~jlvh/2009/04/23/It+works%21" title="It works!">It works&#33;</a> blog.</p>

<p>To deploy OpenRemote 1.0 Milestone 1 you will need a Linux based computer with JavaVM+Tomcat and LIRC installed. We've tested M1 with <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/Infrared+Hardware">CommandIR II</a> infrared transmitter. Other LIRC compatible IR transmitters may also work but we can't make any guarantees at this point. The hardware/operating system/infrared combinations we've tested M1 with are ALIX/Voyage/CommandIR (see <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/OpenRemote+Reference+Implementation+-+Hardware+Bill+of+Materials" title="OpenRemote Reference Implementation - Hardware Bill of Materials">OpenRemote RI</a>) and B202/Ubuntu/CommandIR.</p>

<p>The Beehive and User Interface Composer components of Milestone 1 have been deployed and are available online at <a href="http://composer.openremote.org/demo">http://composer.openremote.org/demo</a>. This application can be used to generate the controller.xml, iphone.xml and lircd.conf files necessary for controller deployment.</p>



<h4><a name="WhatisincludedinOpenRemote1.0Milestone1%3F-Whatisnotincluded"></a>What is not included</h4>

<p>OpenRemote 1.0 Milestone 1 does <b>not</b> include any KNX or X10 functionality. These are scheduled for OpenRemote 1.0 release and will appear in subsequent milestone releases.</p>

<p>The iPhone user interface is limited to the most basic button layout in M1. OpenRemote 1.0 <b>Milestone 2</b> will extend this functionality significantly allowing more customizable user interfaces.</p>
