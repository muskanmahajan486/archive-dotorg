				    <p>OpenRemote Boss 1.0 <b>Milestone 3</b> is a developer release which includes an end-to-end infrared implementation and support for KNX and certain IP-based protocols. Apple iPhone and iPod Touch are supported as panel hardware. The recently <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~juha/2009/08/11/OpenRemote+Goes+Android" title="OpenRemote Goes Android">announced Android panel implementation</a> should still be considered alpha-quality and is not included in this release (but is available separately from <a href="http://openremote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openremote/trunk/Panels/Android/">subversion repository</a>).</p>

<p><b>Milestone 3</b> is the last milestone before OR Boss 1.0 release. It is largely feature-complete with an exception of X10 library integration and some tweaks to KNX functionality. Fully supported protocols include infrared via LIRC (requires Linux as the OS platform), KNX, TCP/IP, HTTP and Telnet for IP-enabled devices. These protocols are supported as unidirectional messages to trigger commands. Bidirectional protocols will not yet be supported in the Boss 1.0 release.</p>

<p>OpenRemote Boss 1.0 M3 has been deployed and the User Interface Composer is available online at <a href="http://composer.openremote.org/demo">http://composer.openremote.org/demo</a>. A stand-alone controller binary can be downloaded <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openremote/files/OpenRemote-Controller-1.0.0_Beta6_JavaOnly.zip/download">here</a>. The stand-alone controller binary is a pure Java version and as such requires that LIRC to be installed separately.</p>

<p>New features in M3 include:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Controller auto-discovery from iPhone or iPod Touch consoles.</li>
	<li>KNX, TCP/IP, HTTP and Telnet protocol support in UI Composer.</li>
	<li>Macro delay configuration</li>
</ul>


<p>Features added in previous milestone:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Ability to create multiple screens in iPhone user interface layout</li>
	<li>Grid size in the iPhone UI layout can be altered</li>
	<li>Button size can be altered to span multiple rows or columns in the grid</li>
	<li>Button labels can be altered from their defaults or translated to other languages</li>
	<li>Button labels can be replaced by icon images</li>
	<li>Default icon theme can be configured for the UI Composer</li>
	<li>Custom user icons and images can be uploaded to the iPhone console layout</li>
	<li>Macros can be nested</li>
</ul>




<h4><a name="WhatisincludedinOpenRemote1.0Milestone3%3F-Whatisnotincluded"></a>What is not included </h4>

<p>UPnP protocol support (contributed by <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~mgallissot">Mathieu Gallissot</a>) and GC protocol code (from <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~marcf">Marc Fleury</a> and <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~ebariaux">Eric Bariaux</a>) is not included in this milestone. You should expect to see them in 1.1 and/or 2.0 release of OR Boss.</p>

<p>All protocol implementations are unidirectional. Bidirectional protocols (e.g. status updates to iPhone console) are not yet supported.</p>

<p>Android console application has not been completely tested against OR Boss 1.0 M3. While the Android implementation is expected to work against M3 it should still be considered untested and experimental.</p>
