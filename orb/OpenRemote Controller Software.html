				    <p>OpenRemote Controller is the brains of the <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb">ORB</a>. It is written in Java and C with a modular architecture.</p>

<p>The role of the controller is to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Serve up UI interfaces to remotes, either as web UI or as a client-server setup for native user interfaces.</li>
	<li>Receive commands from the remotes (e.g act as a daemon server listening to incoming commands)</li>
	<li>Translate and route commands to integrated runtimes (e.g issue a KNX or X10 command)</li>
</ol>


<p>The controller is designed to run on a Linux operating system (currently targeting Debian derivatives). While large parts of controller is running on a cross-platform Java runtime, specific integration areas and access to USB, serial and infrared are implemented in native code.</p>


<h2><a name="OpenRemoteControllerSoftware-ModularDesign"></a>Modular Design</h2>

<p>OpenRemote Controller is by definition an open ended environment designed to integrate with any automation protocol - be it infrared, X10, Insteon, ZigBee or KNX. The controller integrates with existing home automation equipment using:</p>

<ul>
	<li>USB port(s)</li>
	<li>serial port(s)</li>
	<li>Ethernet</li>
	<li>Wifi (802.11 b/g/n)</li>
</ul>


<p>All consumer brands offer at least one of the above media to access their devices or networks. OpenRemote Controller can act as a bridge between the vendor networks translating protocols between them and freeing you from a vendor lock-in. We do not intend to offer you yet another vendor specific solution to automating your home or a building, rather to take advantage of existing investment and products in the field and provide them with state-of-the-art tooling and software implementations. As long as you favorite product can communicate with one of the media listed above, it can be integrated with the ORB.</p>


<h3><a name="OpenRemoteControllerSoftware-SupportedDialects"></a>Supported Dialects</h3>


<p>A parallel is to think of human language.&nbsp; We communicate with other via voice, text, that is the medium we discussed above.&nbsp; But what we say is the language, the dialect. In effect A controller is a translator of dialects, from the ORB esperanto to a target runtime.&nbsp; There are limitations as not all languages are the same. For example X10 and IR dialects have no notions of status feedback whereas Insteon, KNX and Crestron do.</p>

<p>Today we support the following device dialects</p>
<ul>
	<li>X10: The grand-daddy of home automation protocols is much derided but millions of homes in the US are equiped with it. There is also a wealth of products that are compatible with X10.&nbsp; At OR, X10 is one of the first protocols we support.</li>
	<li>IR devices (Hex codes):<br/>
IR control is still, by and large a very popular solution for Audio and Video.&nbsp; The latest TV you bought may not have IP control or even a Serial protocol implemented but it certainly came with an IR remote.&nbsp; With a base configuration of the ORB you can unify all the remotes laying around on your table.</li>
	<li>KNX: KNX comes from a long line of industrial and commercial offerings.&nbsp; It is the dominant standard in Europe.&nbsp; It is making in-roads in the high-end residential market but is very expensive for most budgets.&nbsp; Its main advantage is a wide array of actuator and sensor vendors around the protocol.&nbsp; Work is ongoing on KNX.</li>
	<li>UPnP. The Universal Plug and Play protocol is supported in OR.</li>
	<li>Various proprietary products.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are looking to contribute a new product integration, we want to hear from you.&nbsp; By integrating with OR you buy yourself flexibility of panel displays and leverage other integrations allowing users and installers to immediately use the product you want supported in their existing installations.</p>
