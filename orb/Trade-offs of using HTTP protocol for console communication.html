				    <p>It has been pointed out in our <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums/Design+Forum" title="Design Forum">forum discussions</a> that using HTTP as a protocol for a home automation consoles is not necessarily ideal.</p>

<p>The argument builds on the connectionless nature of HTTP and the need for a bidirectional information exchange between the <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb">ORB</a> and panels and consoles.</p>

<p>For example, a home owner physically turning off lights from the switch will generate an event that will update the ORB and panels/consoles of the status of the light. This type of bidirectional communication is not natural for request-response oriented HTTP protocol.</p>

<p>However, the above can be solved (and has been solved) for HTTP using various polling techniques. The counter-argument is that this is inefficient use of resources. While the counter-argument is correct, the level and amount of events being generated is such that it should be well managed even with an ill-fitting HTTP protocol framework. </p>

<p>On the other side of the decision weighs the undisputed ubiquity of HTTP as a protocol, the wealth of knowledge in handling and processing HTTP protocol and existing tools and libraries to do it.</p>

<p>Therefore, HTTP is the choice of communication protocol for the initial implementations. Should it prove inadequate, better custom designed protocols are of course considered.</p>
