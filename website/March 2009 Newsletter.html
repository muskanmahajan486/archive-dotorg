<div class = "info">
  <img class = "infoimage" src = "http://openremote.org/download/attachments/11960350/Info_64x60.png"/><div class="" align='justify'><p>You are receiving this email because you have registered a user account at <a href="http://www.openremote.org">http://www.openremote.org</a>. We've recently updated our website and in the process reset all user passwords. Please follow instructions on how to reactivate your account at the end of this email.</p></div>

</div>



<div class="" align='justify'><p>Greetings from OpenRemote project. After a bit of a hiatus it's time to get back to our normal routine of updating you on our progress. While it took a longer than usual for this update to arrive, you can expect to hear more frequently from us from now on.</p>
</div>



<h4><a name="March2009Newsletter-WebsiteUpdate"></a>Website Update</h4>

<div class="" align='justify'><p>Main reason for our prolonged silence was a complete revamp of our website. We've restructured a lot of information, thrown out some, wrote a bunch of new content. We hope the new website will serve our user community well. We've added more ways to interact and collaborate and will keep adding more soon.</p>

<p>While things are quickly taking shape on the website, a lot remains to be done. Should you find something odd, an unfinished page, a broken link or anything else amiss, just let us know. You can ping us on the <a href="http://host71120.123flashchat.com/openremote">chat</a> or leave a message on the <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/forums">forums</a>. </p></div>


<h4><a name="March2009Newsletter-FirstEndtoEndPrototype"></a>First End-to-End Prototype</h4>

<div class="" align='justify'><p>We didn't spend all our time just tweaking a website. In the meantime we also put together a first end-to-end prototype of the OpenRemote system. The first milestone is targeting infrared with X10 and KNX following soon. Jean-Luc <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/~jlvh/2009/03/27/We%27re+getting+somewhere%21" title="We're getting somewhere!">wrote about it here</a> with some photos. In short, the first prototype we have running comes with an <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/iPhone+Native+Console+Overview" title="iPhone Native Console Overview">iPhone native application</a> communicating with <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/OpenRemote+Reference+Implementation+-+Hardware+Bill+of+Materials" title="OpenRemote Reference Implementation - Hardware Bill of Materials">OpenRemote Box (ALIX hardware)</a> over a WiFi connection. The incoming commands are then translated to other media, in this case infared and sent out to the corresponding device.</p>

<p>This is a great milestone for us &#8211; it's a proof of concept that actually works (imagine that!) and it establishes the infrastucture we will build on for other automation system integration. It is also a foundation for other tools we are building, for example a building modeler and <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/orb/User+Interface+Composer+Overview" title="User Interface Composer Overview">user interface composer</a>.</p></div>



<h4><a name="March2009Newsletter-FollowUs"></a>Follow Us</h4>

<p>To make it easier for you to follow what we are doing, we've set up an account on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/openremote">Twitter</a> where we regularly give quick updates on what is happening. We also have a channel up on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/openremote">YouTube</a> which you can subscribe to for updates on demos and tutorials. The usual <a href="http://www.openremote.org/display/project/Feeds" title="Feeds">RSS and Atom feeds</a> are as well available and you can always drop by on the <a href="http://host71120.123flashchat.com/openremote">chat</a> and ask what we are currently working on.</p>



<h4><a name="March2009Newsletter-ReactivatingYourAccount"></a>Reactivating Your Account</h4>

<p>As part of the website update we migrated all user accounts from the old website software to the new one. However, in the process all user passwords were reset to new values.</p>

<p>If you want to keep using your existing user name, follow these steps &#8211; go to the <a href="http://openremote.org/login.action">login form</a> on the website. On the login screen, you can ask a temporary password to be sent to your email address. Once you've received an email with a temporary password, login and change your password.</p>

<p>If you've forgotten your username, you can also have that emailed to you. Simply enter the email address you used to register with our website and a reminder will be sent with your username and temporary password to login to the site.</p>

<p>That's all for now. Look for the first milestone of OpenRemote to appear soon.</p>
